Well, now she's starting to have some contractions, but the nurses at the hospital said she was okay to go home for the night.  They said most likley she will start going into labor on her own by tomorrow morning, and if not, they will induce the labor.

Or maybe it\'s just being talked about more.  Or maybe my recent experience with them has just made me notice more.  I first noticed this trend in a thread at <a href="http://www.cliesource.com">ClieSource</a> titled <a href="http://www.cliesource.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=18860">"The NX Blink from Hell"</a>.  Over the last week I have had two hard resets.  Once, I was doing something that made my Clie freeze up, and a soft reset turned out to be a hard reset.  Then, while playing <a href="http://www.viex.org/?page=tabletennis3D">TableTennis 3D</a> , my Clie froze again.  I think it had a Fatal Error.  Upon reset, I didn\'t get a logo, but instead, my screen quickly blinked white on and off.  Kinda like a strobe light.  I tried soft resets, warm resets, nothing would work.  So hard reset it was.  \nWell, today I was reading <a href="http://www.clieplanet.com">CliePlanet</a> and noticed that Shaun McGill, another fellow NX user has also had a recent hard reset.  I hope this doesn\'t continue, or else we can\'t make fun of those PPC users anymore. :)',

This should have been included in the first place, and I've had it on my NX for a little while, thanks to the fact that the TG series Clies came with the updated Flash player a few months ago.  Plus, an offical NetFront update is nice since I have heard of many issues with the software.  Don't use it myself since I don't have any Internet access on my Clie, but it's still nice to know that maybe Sony does care just a little bit.

			"Saw <a href=\"http://www.terminator3.com/\">Terminator 3</a> tonight!  I've been waiting about 12 years to see this movie, and I think it was worth it. I also got to see Zoolander again today since my friend <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/comics/vitale/\">Neil Vitale</a> loaned me the DVD.  It's one of my favorite movies and it's funny every time I see it.\nAnyhow's, T3 really expanded on the Terminator series, and it seemed to be very true to the story.  Takes place about 10 years after T2, and is full of a lot of action.  Some of the best action scenes I have seen.  Arnold is back, and he seems to play a darker Terminator is this movie compared to T2.  He seems to be a bit more like the Terminator from the first movie.  One thing I can say, is the movie is non-stop.  The movie was coming to an end, and it was about an hour and a half through, but it felt like it went very quick.  I don't think there was one scene that dragged out.  T2, had some scenes where they would be driving in the car, or at a couple of different places hiding out, but this movie had everyone on the move, doing something non-stop.  The only thing was, the end really made you feel like you only saw half of a movie.  I know T4 is supposed to be out next year, but it's going to be a long wait.  I wouldn't say the ending is necessarily bad, it does clear up a lot of things, and make much of the movie fulfilling, but at the same time, you feel like you want something more.",

I guess it's not really all that bad, but without the moustache, I look more my age, and I just would like to see how that works.  Also, I have some hair dye, and I'm going to lighten my hair color.  That ought to be interesting.  I've had blonde highlights once and I liked it, but this time I'm going to recolor all of my hair to a lighter shade.  Not quite blonde, but 'sandstorm'.",

			"<a href=\"http://mmplayer.com\">MMPlayer</a> has been updated to include Clie support meaning now Clie handhelds can have a full multimedia player on our machine that doesn't require files to be converted.  The sound playback for the Clie's ain't all that great though (8kHz) since Sony won't release any info to developers on how to fully use the sound system (and for the fact that even though Palm OS 5 has a standard audio system built-in, Sony decided not to use it).  Right now I am doing some experimenting converting a Divx movie into a 320x176 Divx file that will fit onto a 128MB Memory Stick.  But the Memory Stick will only actually hold 123MB of files.   I have the movie down to 125MB by using a Divx calculator and changing the bitrate to 164kB/sec and changing the audio to a 1kB/s MP3 stream (which translates to 8kHz mono audio).  Then I chopped off most of the credits and the opening sequence  that displayed the 20th Century Fox logo. Now I have to converting the video from 24-bit to 16-bit color since that all the Clie can display.  Hey, looks liked it worked and the file is exactly 123MB.  Hopefully this will all work now.\n\nUp until now, the only way to get movies on the Clie was to use either an app called Kinoma or use the built-in Sony Movie Player.  Kinoma's okay, but the file sizes are large since it uses the older Cinepak mobile compression.  The Sony Movie Player plays MPEG-4 based movies, but the are in .MQV format.  It is based on a Quicktime format and the only way to make the movies is to run it through an app called Image Convertor which will convert .MPG's, some .MOV's and some .AVI's.  If the movie doesn't work, you have to use another app to do a 'pre-conversion'.  I use QuickTime Pro for .MOV files and convert the files to .AVI format.  I use VirtualDub for Divx files.  One thing to note is, the audio has to be uncompressed for the Image Convertor to work.  Basically all Divx movies have the audio compressed using MP3 and a lot of higher quality Quicktime videos have some form of compression too.\nSo, for a video to work, you have to run it through an app like VirtualDub, and then just totally guess on what kind of settings to use to output since the Image Convertor does a pretty good job of compressing, but it's hard to tell how much it will do, especially if you want to convert a full movie and fit it on a 128MB stick.  (These movies are over 4GB in their original format.) \n\nSo, whats this got to do with native support for Divx on the Clie?  Well, to fit a Divx movie onto a 128MB stick, it still needs to be converted since these movies are normally around 600-700MB so they will fit on CD.  But, the good news is, I can tell exactly the setting I need to use to convert in VirtualDub, since there is only one conversion being done.  I just use an app called Advanced Divx calculator, plugged in the movie length, size the outputted movie needs to be and audio bitrate and it tells me what bitrate to use for the video.  Plug these settings into the Divx settings (leaving some leeway) and away it goes.  Takes about an hour to do the full conversion on my PC (Athlon XP 2000, 1.6GHz).",

The tires all need to be replaced, the engine has an intake value leak, the brakes are bad and need to be replaced, and the wheel bearings are also going bad.  I figure it's best just to get a new car than to invest a bunch of money into that junker.  Plus, they are doing some great deals to get rid of the 2003 models.

			"Been a little busy recently.  Back to work now, and Nickcole bought a new car, a 2003 Chevy Caviler. \nSome big news in the PDA world.  Sony is going to announce in the US on Friday a new Clie that is totally different from anything else they make.  It looks a lot like the Zaurus unit that came out not to long ago.\n <img src=\"http://k-tai.impress.co.jp/cda/static/image/2003/07/17/cli05.jpg\" alt=\"Clie UX-50\" />\nThis is yet another clamshell PDA and it has a hi-res+ (480x320) screen, but it is in landscape, not portrait orientation.  The older Handera QVGA device was able to do landscape, but it wasn't the native orientation.\nI'm not so sure if this is a device I would use.  I am still very happy with my Clie NX60.  But there are a few items the UX50 has that I like.  It is the first PalmOS device with both Bluetooth and WiFi.  Very 21st century. It has a new CPU made by Sony which is called the Sony Handheld Engine.  Only runs up to 120Mhz or so, but it has a ton of functions built-in to the chip.  It is a scalable chip, like the Intel XScale, but the scaling function is actually enabled on this device. (I don't think a single PDA actually takes advantage of the speed scaling abilities of Intels chip.  The only softwares that do are a few over/underclocking apps.  But this new chip scales on demand anywhere from 8MHz up to the top speed of 120-something MHz.  This is great for the battery life because has fast does the datebook or your e-book reader have to go.  You only use the battery power when you need it.\nSony has included some new functions into this device.  One thing that opens up a lot of possibilities is the built-in software based OpenGL.  It's only software based, so it will probably be limited, but Sony is already taking advantage of it by including a 3D application launcher.\n<img src=\"http://www.sony.jp/products/Consumer/PEG/PEG-UX50/Images/feat4_11.gif\" alt=\"3D Launcher\" />\nThe keyboard on this unit looks like it might be the best one of any of the Clie devices.  I can see this as being more of an E-mail and IM on the go device.  It kinda has a look like the Danger Sidekick device.  If they made a GPRS version of the UX50, it might really be some competition for the Sidekick and the Blackberry.\nWhat are some things that worry me though.  Accessories. My NX60 was able to use NR screen protectors.  As does the NZ.  This is a new size screen I think.  So no screen protectors for now.  Sony probably has one, but it's probably priced high too.  The Hotsync port.  It has been a standard for a while now. All the T-series devices, the NR, the NX, the TG, the NZ, the SJ.  They all have the same connector. Not the UX.  So if you have something you want to hook up, too bad.  Hope you didn't buy that $100 speaker cradle.  Or a GPS unit.  Or a game controller. Another thing, you can't use the headphones remote control with this device since it on'y includes just a standard stero headphone jack.  Many of the higher-end devices (maybe they all do) have an extra plug that a remote control plugs into.  Very nice for controlling your MP3's without having to open your device and fiddle with the stylus.  Also, the jog-dial is no longer a tool to help with using your device one handed.  Its on the bottom and is more of a knob, than a wheel.  Sony pulled a Zire.  They only have three hard buttons on the front.  Every PalmOS device (except the $99 Zire) has had four buttons.  We are looking at a $600-700 device here.  Hope your certain app (or game) doesn't expect you to have certain buttons.\n\nIt's getting late, I need to sleep. I could probably go on, but you can find more info elsewhere.  This is just my opinion, you might love this device.  I think I'll hold out for the next NX.  Hopefully OS6, Bluetooth, WiFi, 64MB (or more) or RAM.  Doesn't sound too outrageous when looking at the UX.",

So, this device might even be out by November.  My Clie NX will be a year old by then, and might be ready to retire :).  If this is the same device that\'s described, then it will be running Palm OS6, though that\'s not shown in the screenshots.  Probably the prototype is running a modified version of Palm OS 5.2 since OS6 isn\'t ready yet.  From earlier screenshots at <a href="http://www.palminfocenter.com/">Palm InfoCenter</a>, it looks like OS6 will natively be hi-res+ (320x480) like the device shown.  Sony and Garmin already have devices with hi-res+ screens and Tapwave has a device on the way.  The Clie UX is rumored to have the OS6 API\'s built-in for it\'s hi-res+ screen and so will the Tapwave device.  I bet Palm will wait until OS6 is actually out until it has a device with the OS6 hi-res+ API.\nI think that a hi-res+ screen is a must on any device I own in the future.  The screen is amazing to look at.  Plus, this TT3 looks fairly slim, especially compared to some of the recent Clie devices.  I hope this device is really coming by the end of the year. I would miss abandoning the Clie platform, but if Sony doesn\'t put something like this on the market by then, I\'ve have no regrets moving to a Palm device.  Sony was keeping way above Palm with the quality and technology of there devices, but now Palm has Sony beat.  The Tungsten C, and now the Tungsten T3.  Sony better have something up their sleeve, and it better be something better than the toy of a PDA, the UX-50.',

This looks to have graphics close to the PS1.\nHere\'s another link. <a href="http://arstechnica.infopop.net/OpenTopic/page?a=tpc&s=50009562&f=34709834&m=4620975863">http://arstechnica.infopop.net/OpenTopic/page?a=tpc&s=50009562&f=34709834&m=4620975863</a>  Don\'t put your Palm in the oven, or you might regret it. \n<img src="http://bios.arsware.org/palm/front1.jpg" alt="" />',

I have never done that before, so that will be something new. :)\nOne thing I am going to be doing soon, and have already started, is something that I have been meaning to do for some time now.  I am compiling past versions of my websites to create an archive here.  Kind of a CBulock.com history.  But this site has actually gone through a number of changes.  It was originally called Omega's Lair and was hosted on Tripod.  Then moved over to Freeservers and became Omega's Lair 2000.  Then, at one point, I purchased the domain name CBulock.com, and then hosted the website off of a PC at my home.  Now it's being hosted by <a href=\"http://www.cirtexhosting.com\">CirtexHosting</a> in it's latest incarnation. I know that Freeservers is still hosting my old website there, and I have found old CD's with some backups of my older websites.  Soon, I will have them accessible here, I just have to get the pages cleaned up a bit.  You'd be surprised how a just a few years how many links and such no longer work.",

I have already completed a number of tests in the computer field from their site.  You can see which one\'s I did on my <a href="http://www.cbulock.com/aboutme.html">About Me</a> page.  Today, I completed a new test, Information Technology Industry Knowledge.  I also re-took the Computer Technical Support Test, since last time I took it, I didn\'t get as good of a score as I had hoped for.  My old score was 3.0 while my new score was 3.13, so it was slightly better.  I also took one of the beta tests, the Food Industry Safety Test and actually got something like a 4.34, which would qualify it for a Master certification. But, since the test is still in a beta version and isn\'t finalized, I don\'t get credit for it.  Hopefully I will be able to do as well when they actually release the test.',

I have pretty much just been every day deleting all my spam one by one, and had a few filters set to look for a couple of keywords that I get all the time (basically Viagra, and Enlargement).  But, now the e-mails have those spelt funny (such as V.i.a.g.r.a. or Vaigra).  So they miss the filters.  Plus, I get tons of other mail anyway.  Now I have a real tool, and it works with my e-mail app.  I see many tools for Outlook and Outlook Express, but I am using the Opera M2 e-mail app that's included in the <a href=\"http://www.opera.com\">Opera</a> browser.  I'm using <a href=\"http://popfile.sourceforge.net/\">POPFile</a> which is an open source app. It's called a bayesian filter which means it uses bayesian logic.   It pretty much means it's a learning filter.  At first, it doesn't do a very good job, but after only a day of use, it's already working with over 90% accuracy.\nEvery time you get mail, it takes a record of the mail and categorizes it as either good or bad.  You can set it so if it is spam, it will change the e-mail header to say [spam] at the beginning.  That way, you can set a filter in your e-mail program to move spam to a separate folder.\nIf the program categorizes the mail wrong, you go into the app and recatagorize it.  The program is then better able to determine what type of mail should go where.  The more you have to recatagorize the mail, the better it gets in the future.\nSome more details on the working of this app. It acts as a proxy server, so you have to change your e-mail settings in your mail client to point to your own machine (i.e. use IP address 127.0.0.1, or use the name localhost)\nTo actually access the app, it uses a web style interface that you access through your browser.  You can access this by going to http://localhost:8080.  Once you go there, you can change all your settings and reclassify your mail.  \nI have a feeling by the end of the week, this app will have my mail up to 99% accurate.  This will be very nice as my mailbox was getting very messy there for a while.",

			"You would think after how many years it took for Bluetooth to finally get into the market, that using it would be a piece of cake.  For some things it is, for some things it's a PITA. Having just recently purchased a Nokia 3650 and getting a Bluetooth dongle for my PC, I have now had my first experience setting up Bluetooth.  For things like sending files back and forth, it's so easy.  Actually, easier than I expected.  Once the devices are in range (10 meters is what it's rated for, but I am in range in the office my PC is in, and in my bedroom and kitchen which are the rooms next to the office), they need to be paired the first time.  It's an easy process, just enter the same code on the PC and on the phone and they see each other.  Then on, you don't have to do anything.  You can set it so each devices will automatically authorize file transfers and such.  It's pretty secure since no one can just access the data with any other device since all devices must enter a passcode the first time they connect.\nNow, whenever I want to send an app, or a ringtone to my phone, all I have to do on my PC is right-click the file, go to the Send To menu, choose Bluetooth, and choose my phone from that menu.  It arrives on my phone in the Inbox where I can install the app, or save a file somewhere.\nSending things back to the PC is just as easy.  If I want to send a picture to my PC, in the imaging app, I can choose the picture, click Options>Send>Bluetooth. Then I have have to select my PC's device name from the list and the file is send right to a folder in My Documents.\nThat process was easy, but the hard part is the PC Suite that comes with the phone and lets you sync your data with MS Outlook. I'd really like to have this feature since my Sony Clie syncs with MS Outlook using Intellisync Lite. I haven't got it working yet, but I have done quite a bit to so far trying.\n\n<i>To be continued...</i>",

Don't know what I was thinking, but moving the NX page to a Movable Type blog format, and implementing the mobile version of Cameron's Thoughts within Movable Type at the same time didn't work out to great.  At first I accidently editted all the template files for the NX page and created a mobile version for that by mistake.  But all the links pointed to the Cameron's Thoughts page.  So you might have seen some of the NX page on this page.  Then, I had a minor mistake in the web site archiving that caused all the archived links to point to the mobile versions even on the full size page, and on the mobile page all the links didn't go anywhere.  It all seems to be working for now.  The main page seems to be working fine at least.  The mobile page might have some bugs still, but none that I can tell right now.  I guess we'll see once I get the NX page back up since I now have to go back and make sure none of the templates for that will overwrite any of these pages.  I have the links all messed up now. :)",

One click of a button and you can access searches such as News, Groups, Images, Froogle.  You can also set custom searches.  It comes with a definition and thesaurus.  Plus they include a movie review search from <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a>.  Also a download search from <a href="http://download.com">CNet\'s Download.com</a>.  I added my own custom search from <a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com">Acronym Finder</a>, making it easy to figure out those strange acronyms.

I've never played the N64 version,so I can't comment on that.\nOne thing that I have not received, the bonus disc that was supposed to be included if you pre-ordered the game.  I did pre-order, but the people at Wal-Mart said they didn't have them in yet,  Actually, the people at Wal-Mart were pretty clueless.  They were advertising the game was going to be available November 18th (even though it was released nationwide on the 17th), but they didn't even have it on the shelf.  The lady I spoke with said she was pretty sure the game wasn't in yet, but then double checked and sure enough, there was a whole box of games not even opened yet in the back.\nBut, now I have it and today I was able to easily (first try) get Gold trophies for all three circuits on the 50cc.  So far I have received a Silver trophy for each race in the 100cc, but I have only played the 100cc races once now. \nThe graphics of the game are basically the same as Mario Sunshine, and I think they basically just took a number of the 3D graphics from Mario Sunshine and just did some minor edits and added them to MK:DD.",

It's been a while and I just finally got the damn PC Suite to work today.  Actually, I have no idea what I did, but when I tried it, it connected to my phone and worked fine.  For the longest time, the PC Suite application kept saying 'Device not Connected' even though it was.  There is another application called mRouter that is required to connect the PC Suite with the phone over Bluetooth and that showed the connection was fine.  There are a number of website forums on the web where many other people have listed the exact same problems that I have had with no solution.  It seems the solution to most problems is just to uninstall everything, the PC Suite, and all the Bluetooth drivers.  Plus, there are a number of different driver versions available and depending on who you ask, some are evil and some are great.  For example, my Bluetooth dongle came with the WIDCOMM ver 1.3.something drivers.  Some people say, 1.4.something is available and it's the newest, so use that.  Others say 1.2 is the best and the newer versions have flaws, so use that.  I've downloaded the different versions, uninstalled and reinstalled so many times I can't even count them.  I even resorted to using the rollback feature of Windows XP (I think it's called System Restore).  Never used it before, but even rolling back to before my first Bluetooth install didn't help.  I eventually gave up and figured I would go without the PC Suite.  But, it's nice to have now since I can back up the phone to the PC.  I would hate to lose all that contact info.  Most of it is backed up on my Clie, but not all of it.",

I am now just waiting at the top of the list for the next opening they have in the tech support department.  I can not wait though.  Seems the bullshit that is McDonald's keeps piling up more and more each day.  You would think mice are running that place.  They might as well be.  Nothing makes any sense around there and I think a group of 4-5 good mice could do a better job.  It's almost embarrassing to be on the management staff there.  At least I don't have any actually power around there.  Things would be much different if that were true.  The place would be run like at actual business with profit in mind, not a fucking kindergarten classroom.  If the owner Joe Fix knew half of what went on there, he would go on a firing frenzy. \nWell, I feel a little better letting that out now.  Have a nice day everyone!! :)",

A couple of days ago I now hit the 3000 mark.  I\'m not sure if this is an accomplishment or what.  My posting frequency there was actually gone done since Hailey was born.  My post per day count was steadily increasing until I reached 8 posts per day.  Now I am down to like 7.3.  Not a big difference I guess.\nThere was been a bit of annoyance there recently too.  Some poster by the name of napoli was been stirring up trouble in every thread he can.  Every post in the NX forum is "You should just get an UX50".  Then he keeps harping on newbies (which he is himself, he just thinks he\'s superior because he now has the title of Senior Member only because he has posted almost 200 times without any content in the posts).  What\'s really annoying is the constant use of CAPS LOCK and incorrect spelling. (I have bad spelling, but he doesn\'t even try).  He calls himself a Sony Product Analyst, but I think he is just some 13 year old kid getting off on causing trouble. Another thing that is annoying is something he started today. Every time someone made any small talk not 100% related to the topic, he has to respond "this isn\'t a chat board, please stay on topic, I\'m trying to improve these forums by keeping them about Clies only" or some crap like that.\nHe is driving me nuts.  Oh well, the mods will take care of him by tomorrow.\nI also hope to have some good news involving ClieSource here in the near future, but I don\'t think I should post it just yet.',

A camera with 27 pics only cost $5.  But it took a lot of walking around the mall to find one.

They did provide me with free hosting, which was nice, but I was getting what I paid for.  So, in some crazy error on my part, I moved the site to EQ Servers.  Bad idea.  Within days of getting the site up and running, a hacker broke into the server and defaced all the websites.  No big deal, was able to restore.  Then days later after I made a number of minor updates to this site (which I will be redoing here shortly), EQ Servers restored my site from a backup days before.  So, days worth of info were lost.  I contacted the host, Kane Hart, and he said he could probably restore the data from another backup.  That was the last I ever heard from him.  Now he will never respond to any support tickets or e-mails.\nWell, now the site has been moved once again, this time to <a title="Personal Sites" href="http://www.personalsites.org">PersonalSites.org</a>.  They have some pretty nice deals and seem to have a good reputation.  Hopefully this will be the last move for a while.',

I got the code from <a href="http://www.timaoutloud.org/code/mt" title="tima thinking outloud.">here.</a>  Was a bit complicated as the a couple of Movable Type plugins had to be installed, and the code had to be added to the page here and set up to fit in with the rest of the design.  Then, I had to set up a cron job on the server since Movable Type doesn\'t dynamically update the pages every time someone loads then, they are rebuilt when needed (content is updated, or manually when code is updated).  So, a cron job had to be set up for the pages to rebuild every once in a while (I have it set for one hour now, will adjust if necessary) so the news will be fairly up to date.  Hopefully it will all update properly.  I am also adding a <a href="http://www.geourl.com" title="GeoURL">GeoURL</a> link to this page.  It\'s a pretty cool service where you tell them the exact location your website is at (well, at least where I am at), and then it will show you other websites physically near yours.

But, today they called me and asked if I was still interested in the job. Of course I still was, so they said it would be one to three weeks while they did some background checks and let the paperwork run through the HR department.  I am pretty excited.  McDonald's has been a shit job recently (well, it's never been great, but now is worse than normal).  Let's just say it's been going on two years since I have seen an increase in pay.  And now they are working our asses off.  Not sure if I can quote the expected labor percent McDonalds policies expect a store to follow, but I can say that we have been running WAY under the correct labor rate.  At some times the labor percent is half of what it should be (each person is on average doing the job of two people, and when you figure in the lazy asses you can barely do their own job, some people are doing the work of three or more people).  Ah, so is life.  At least the owner of the store is able to spend more time on vacation in Florida than at home. And that's no exaggeration either.  The first two months of this year he is going to be in Florida over six weeks, and last year he was down there at least half the year.  At least my lack of raises has been going to good use. :(",

For example, the user could be writing a letter on one part of the screen, then create a window and begin another.</i></p></blockquote>\nGotta love how they had to describe what a &quot;mouse&quot; and &quot;windows&quot; are.  Crazy to think that only 20 years ago these were not everyday terms.',

			'<p>I have never heard of this clown before, but he is apparently "in the industry". Charles Cooper from <a href="http://www.cnet.com/" title="CNet.com">CNet </a>decided to ask the question, <a href="http://news.com.com/Why%20does%20PC%20support%20stink%20Ask%20Symantec/2010-7350_3-5593437.html" title="Why does PC support stink? Ask Symantec">"Why does PC support stink?"</a>.  He is under the impression that his support issues with Symantec are all Symantecs fault and are a prime example of the tech support field.</p>\n<p>All he really shows in this article that he wrote is that most problems people have with their computer all come down to the same issue.  This is something that causes more computer trouble than all virus\'s, spyware and Microsoft bugs combined.  This issue is something called PEBKAC.  Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Chair.\nWhat do I mean by this?  All headaches that Charles had were all user problems and misunderstandings.  Not problems that Symantec caused.\nWhat Charles was upset about was he was being charged for calling tech support.  Symantec makes no hidden claims in what the charges are.  Go to their <a href="http://www.symantec.com/techsupp/support_options.html" title="Symantec Support">support page</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fee-based Technical Support\n$29.95 per incident, 6 A.M. to 5 P.M. PT, Monday through Friday\n(Fee may be waived if Support Representative determines that the issue was caused by the product.)</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p> Virus Removal Support\n$39.95 - $69.95 per incident, 6 A.M. to 5 P.M. PT, Monday through Friday</p></blockquote>\n<p>That seems pretty clear to me.  But, what is the other thing that Charles was upset about.  Oh yea, he had to wait for two hours on hold.  And, he called on a Sunday.  But, the hours listed show they offer support Monday-Friday.  I would say he is lucky anyone ever answered.  Does this guy think the world should just serve him however he wants whenever he wants at his terms?  If they state that they offer support at a certain amount at certain times, that\'s what will happen.  Don\'t complain because you can\'t comprehend basic English.</p>\n<p>Now, don\'t get me wrong.  I am not saying that nothing is wrong with Symantec at all.  That is quite a bit of money to pay for support.  At the same time, computer support is just expensive.  But, that\'s why you shouldn\'t purchase software if you don\'t agree with the terms of the cost\'s assoicated with using and supporting the product.  I mean, there are alternatives to Norton Anti-Virus.  Acutally, there are some pretty decent free one\'s such as <a href="http://www.grisoft.com/" title="AVG Anti-Virus">AVG</a> and <a href="http://www.avast.com/" title="avast! antiviru software">Avast</a>.  At least if you went that route, you wouldn\'t feel so ripped off if you didn\'t get something for free that you were execpting.</p>\n\n<p class="footer_note">Update (03-07-05 12:09PM):I made an update to this post to correct a mis-statement of mine that was incorrect.</p>',

I didn't want to attempt another re-install just to get the sync to work as I figured another reinstall would probably do more harm than good.\nI read through the instructions very closely, and it said to hit this 'New Task' button to tell it to sync with Outlook.  Every time I hit 'New Task', the app would look like it's doing something for a second, then just do nothing.\nWell, today I upgraded to the latest version of PC Suite.  I don't really notice anything new about it, probably just some bug fixes, but now when I hit 'New Task', it actually allows me to choose a task.  Now all my contacts are syncing between my PC, Nokia 3650, and my Sony Clie NX60 (thanks to Intellisync).  I feel so much more organized now, but at the same time wonder how much longer my Clie NX would be of use.  Now all my appointments and contacts are on my 3650, all my Clie does is store my shopping list, some handwritten notes, and it has some spreadsheets that I use.",

			"Back in November, I <a href=\"http://www.cbulock.com/archives/000061.html\" title=\"Free Palm Software on SD Cards\">mentioned a chance to win a free SD card.</a>  It was a long wait, but I finally received the card I choose a couple days ago.  I signed up for the Atari Retro game pack.  It's pretty cool and has some of my favorites like Missile Command and Asteroids. It was advertised to be on SD cards, but in fact it was on an MMC card.  For those who don't know, the cards both have the same basic form factor, SD card format is a little newer, but adds a write protect switch, a couple pins for a security setup and is nearly twice as thick.  Almost all SD cards slots will accept an MMC card, but some devices will only take MMC.  This was nice, because my good 'ol 3650 only takes MMC cards and this Atari Retro pack works for that too.  Actually, it is playable on all Palm OS5 systems with MMC/SD card slots, all Pocket PC 2002 and above systems with MMC/SD card slots and all Symbian Series 60 phones with an MMC slot.  When I signed up, I thought it was only for Palm.  And my Sony Clie doesn't have an SD card slot, only Memory Stick, though I was hoping to copy the files from the MMC card to the MS using a card reader. I tried it, but it would never work no matter what I did.  I also tried playing the games on the 3650, but it just was not the same playing with the little direction arrows on the phone.  So, my experience hasn't quite been what I was hoping for.  If I could get it to play on the Clie, I would probably enjoy the game more.  But, I have instead decided to sell the game, so I will probably be putting it on EBay shortly.",

And all digital.  I was using digital cable a little while back, but I had to cut back on that to save some money.  I do miss it a little.  Plus, right now, you can get a system with a <a href="http://www.expertsatellite.com/catalog/default.php?exp_affil=ref268584" title="Cheap DirecTV w/ TiVo from Expert Satellite">40 hour TiVo built-in for only $50.</a>  DirecTV only charges $5 a month for the TiVo service too. Usually it is more (I think $13).  TiVo is something I know I will want to have eventually, and the DirecTV setup is the way to go.  It has multiple tuners so you can record while watching TV, or record two shows at once.  Not something you can do with digital cable.  You might notice that I have a little ad to the side of my main page.  I added that for two reasons.  One, to help support this site.  It doesn\'t run for free.  But, secondly, it\'s a real good deal, and I want to pass this on to others.',

Also of interest, it seems Sony is going to give Japan, American, and Europe all different devices with different wireless setups.  It seems like in Japan, only the TH55 is getting WiFi, while in the US, both the TH55 and TJ37 are rumored to include it.  The test devices the FCC seen also had mention of Bluetooth, so it\'s quite possible that feature will only be seen in Europe, like they did with the NX73 being BT only in Europe.  There is also a <a href="http://www.sony.jp/CLIE/products/demo/PEG-TH55/index.html" title="TH-55 Demo">nice Flash demo</a> of the TH55 on Sony Japan\'s website.\nHere are some specs from <a href="http://www.cliesource.com" title="ClieSource">ClieSource</a>\n\n<b>Cli&eacute; TH55</b>\n- OS: PalmOS 5 (Ver.5.2.1)\n- CPU: 123MHz SONY Handheld Engine (same as the UX-series)\n- Memory: DRAM - 32MB / ROM - 32MB\n- Display: 320x480 / 65536 colors\n- WiFi: 802.11b\n- Clie Organizer\n- 0.31 megapixel - digital camera (640x480 max. resolution)\n- MQV (Quicktime), MPEG-1 Playback\n- Voice Recorder\n- No mention of Bluetooth although some images do have a Bluetooth LED.\n- 2.89 in x 4.78 in x .62 in (approximately)\n- Comes in Black or Red',

			"Got a nice deal on a SB Live 5.1 card off of EBay.  Only $10 with shipping.  It was advertised as a Sound Blaster 128 card.  I just wanted to get a card that had support for rear speakers since I got a Creative 4.1 surround sound speaker set for Christmas from my mom.  I'm not a big audio fanatic, so I had just been using the stereo sound that came built into the motherboard on my PC.  So I was very surprised to see the card was even better than the one advertised. \nI have had a little trouble with it though. I think there is some sort of resource conflict.  Most likely with my NIC.  What happens is, every time I start my computer up, I am not on the Internet. What I have to do is go into the network connection properties in XP and disable the connection, then re-enable it.  Then it works fine.  But, I have to do this every time I restart.  I tried moving the NIC to another PCI slot, but that didn't help.  \nMy solution to that for the time being is to use the onboard NIC.  The story for that is a strange one too.  My PC came with an onboard NIC like many PC's do now.  Remember that big power outage that hit the northeast in '03?  Well, I was on the edge of the outage (my town didn't lose any power, but many of the nearby cities did.)  Instead, we had just lost power for a few minutes, then go hit with a nice surge.  I have surge protectors on all my equipment, but maybe they are getting old or something.  Because my speakers on my PC made a deafening screeching sound.  Then I noticed my NIC was no longer working.  I quickly replaced it with a PCI NIC to get back on the Internet.  But, I then realized from time to time my onboard NIC was recognized by Windows.  What happens is, if I restart the PC, the NIC is gone.  If I completely shut down, then it will return on next start up.  Annoying, since I usually just restart because I don't want to wait for a shutdown to occur to restart.  It takes about three minutes for this piece of shit to shutdown.\nSo, anyways, I at least have a backup network solution for the time being.  But, the sound is still having some trouble.  It keeps having this trouble where every 20 seconds or so, it will freeze up for a second and make a terrible jittering sound.  This makes listening to music impossible.  I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers and even updated my motherboard drivers.  I think the next step is a Windows reinstall.  Not just because of this, the whole computer is just running like crap lately. Too many programs installed and a number that have been removed, but probably not all the way.  Somehow almost 35GB of this drive has been taken up, and that is in less than a year.  I have other drives filled with data from the past.  What is taking up all that space??  :\\  I have no idea.",

			"The next two Operating Systems from PalmSource have been <a href=\"http://www.pdalive.com/showarticle.php?threadid=5436\" title=\"Welcome PalmSource&rsquo;s new Palm OS Cobalt and Palm OS Garnet\">announced</a> today, Palm Cobalt and Palm Garnet.  Palm Cobalt was originally thought to be called OS6, since all OS's prior have been named by there version number.  But, PalmSource has decided to change that.  That is because Garnet is actually a newer version of OS5 specially designed for use in smartphones.  PalmSource thought it would be better to show that the two OS's are designed for different uses while both being up to date.  If they were simply called OS6 and OS5.4, then the smartphones would have trouble selling with an 'old' OS. \nI personally don't know if this is the best strategy.  Microsoft has done something like this by having Windows Mobile and Windows Smartphone OS's.  But with Palm OS market share dropping fast to competitors such as Windows Mobile and Nokia's Symbian Series 60, I don't know if this is the best time to segment their main products. Time will tell.",

PalmSource didn\'t add the updated GUI. I didn\'t mind that so much as long as they were too busy getting everything else working.\nBut, I also read that they support higher screen resolutions (up to 32000 x 32000!) but they don\'t entirely support them. The article said that the OS doesn\'t completely support VGA and a licensee would need to make some changes for full VGA support.\nPlus, there is NOT support for switching between landscape and portrait modes. As Ed mentioned, he was told there would be support for that, and I could have sworn I read that in some document that described the OS6 API. I wondered what happened.\nI also <a href="http://www.cliesource.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=41606" title="Ed Hardy\'s Cobalt Impressions at Brighthand">posted this at Cliesource </a>to see what other people think about this.',

I have every e-mail from as far back as 2000 (well, not the spam, otherwise I'd have a 120GB drive full of mail.) So it was important that I didn't lose anything. :)  I have also reinstalled all the essential apps such as instant messengers, video and imaging apps, and most of my Internet stuff.  I still have to install my Clie stuff and my Nokia 3650 stuff (fuck, I don't want to deal with the Bluetooth install again :crying: )  So, I still have work to do, but I have done enough today.",

(The OS is Win XP BTW)\n\n<ul>\n<li>I first tried reinstalling the device drivers. That had no effect, so I went and made sure I had the latest drivers and I do.</li>\n\n<li>I then went ahead and updated the motherboard drivers. That also had no effect.</li>\n\n<li>Since I needed to anyways, I went ahead and reinstalled Windows. I normally wouldn\'t have given up so quickly, but I planned on doing this within a few weeks anyway. Still, same results.</li>\n\n<li>So, I made sure to reinstall all the drivers. I also had some trouble with my NIC card since I installed the sound card. I had an onboard NIC and a PCI NIC, so I just removed the PCI NIC.</li>\n\n<li>I moved the sound card to a different PCI slot since after removing the PCI NIC, the IRQ of the onboard NIC and sound card were the same. I have now verified that nothing shares any resources with the sound card.</li>\n\n<li>I also went into the Control Panel, then Sounds and Audio Devices. I went to the Audio tab, advanced properties and turned down the hardware acceleration. This seemed to work the other day, but now I am having the sound problems again.</li></ul>\n\nThat\'s everything I have done so far. I kind of stuck now.

			"Sunday is my last day of work at McDonald's.  Going on nearly six years of working there it is going to be a big thing leaving there.  It is hard to imagine how well I know some of the people I work with.  There are a number of people who have been there since before I started as well as a number of people who have worked quite a bit of that time.  Many of these people I know almost their complete life stories and how they feel about so many things.  I know these people better than my own family.  So it is hard to just say \"Bye\" and just leave.  But it needs to be done.  I have to remember that this is just a small phase of my total life.  While right now, this job seems like everything there is, many years from now those six short years will seem insignificant. I can tell this as when leaving high school almost four years ago, :O at that time it seemed so crazy not to see these people that I had spent the past 13 years with no longer.  But only a short time later, school seems like a distant memory and I really do not miss anyone.  I still am friends with Patrick, and I still see a few other people from time to time.  But that's it.  All just a distant memory, as my years at McDonald's will still be.\nAnyone who is reading this might be wondering why I am reflecting back at my years at this fast food job almost in a positive way.  Well, I am, but not the actual job itself.  It's the co-workers who made it a great place to be.  Not all of them, and probably not even the majority.  I guess eventually you just block out the negative and the whole crappy work day is hidden from long term memory. I mostly just remember the good times, and the funny times.  There are so many things that happen there, involving employee's or customers.  Lot's of unbelievable stuff.  And no, there is no memories of people spitting on food, or picking up food off the floor and serving it.  I have never seen anything like that happen.\nMaybe I will post some of the memories that stick out, but not today.  Today the whole thing will me leaving has really started to come to reality.  Today was the last night that I would close, which is what I usually do.  It was also the last time I would work with some people like Bob and Pat.  It's weird to think I will never work with them again.  So, this is all really coming to reality inside my head, and I have to get ready for the next step in my life. \nFuture, here I come!",

Me and my friends Curtis and Patrick used to do this back in Junior High all the time when they used to do the 1-in-6 wins a free Dew.  We rarely had to pay for the pops.  Looking back now, I can see this is wrong and pretty much stealing, but at the time I just thought it was cool and fun.  I am just surprised it\'s taking the general public this long to realize this trick, something I was doing as a little boy.',

Was going to hang out with my friend Patrick and a bunch of other people, but I forgot to line up a babysitter until the last minute, and then it was too late.  So, instead I went and purchased a new TV that Nickcole and I have been planning on buying out of our tax refund.  It\'s a 27", so not a whole lot bigger than our previous 25".  But the last TV we bought was really cheap, and we bought it before we got married back in 2000.  So, it\'s nothing great.  This new one is really nice.  It has a flat tube, and 700 lines of resolution with a digital comb filter.  I guess that makes signal take advantage of all the additional scan lines since the highest resolution input is 480.  But the TV also includes some nice inputs such as component video, in addition to the S-Video, composite video and RF input found on most sets. Our old TV had only a single RF input making it very complicated to get a VCR, DVD player, Dreamcast, Gamecube, digital camera, and previously digital cable all connected.',

I usually will completely avoid movies like this since all the reading takes away from enjoying the movie.  But, in this movie, it wasn't bad at all.

The movie basically depicted the arrest and brutal punishment that Jesus went through in his last hours with the movie finishing with the crucifixion. The movie was almost 2 1/2 hours long, and the movie was basically about the last four hours of his life, so, you can imagine that there wasn't much that was left out.  This isn't a movie for kids at all.  I really have no idea how they made it so realistic.  The scene during and after Jesus was being punished was amazingly real.  You can see his body being ripped apart.  It's actually quite hard to watch. It really does make you think though.  No matter if you believe that Jesus is the son of God, or not, most people agree that the events of Jesus' last hours are pretty accurate and did actually occur.",

I LOVE Series 60 and this is the first clamshell Series 60 phone.  Ever since purchasing my Nokia 3650, I have been wondering about my need for a Palm OS device.   Maybe my NX60 will be my last PDA.  I don\'t really use it much anymore.  I have all my contacts and calendar synced to my phone, and it actually does an even better job than my Palm.  The new Cobalt OS will have better support for syncing more fields with MS Outlook, but Series 60 already does.\nThere isn\'t a whole lot of info out yet on the X700, but it does look nice and J&oslash;rgen Sundgot gave the physical characteristics such as the keypad and navigation keys a good review.  That kind of stuff is important, especially since I already know the software inside is good.  Sundgot is pretty accurate in reviews in my opinion so I would trust this device will be pretty nice.  I am curious about the RAM though.  Series 60 doesn\'t really have any high requirements, but a nice supply of RAM is good for multi-tasking.  Opera really eats it up too when surfing the web.  That\'s yet another reason I question the need for a Palm device.  I would like the large screen to surf websites, and NetFront is a nice browser.  But, Opera for Series 60 (for any device actually), just kicks the ass of NetFront.  It\'s a full desktop browser with compliance to every standard, desktop and mobile.\nAnyways, Series 60 is about the only way I will go with any future phone, the software library is already large and growing fast.  Everything about the system is nice.  I would also like a clamshell phone.

			"I don't know why, but recently my computer can't keep track of time anymore.  A little bit a go, I was almost late for work because my computer said I had about an hour before I had to be there, but in fact I only had about 20 minutes (this was when I was working at McDonald's).  I reset the clock.  I have then been having to reset it more frequently as the last couple of weeks have been going on.  I have Windows set to automatically update the clock, but it only happens once a week.  My friend Neil says I can change that setting, but he never explained how.  So, I have downloaded a freeware app called <a href=\"http://www.itoolpad.com/products/timesync/\" title=\"Time Synchronizer\">Time Synchronizer</a>.  It updates to an atomic clock at the frequency that you set.  I have to have it update every hour because I have now figured out I am losing about 2 seconds every minute.  Might not sound like too much, but that is two minutes every hour.  Leave the computer for 10 hours and come back, the computer is 20 minutes off.  Windows' little weekly update isn't very effective for this problem.  I would like to find out what is causing this because right now I haven't really solved the problem, I am only masking it.  So, for now my clock should be okay, but now that means I need yet another app eating up my precious RAM.  If anyone has any idea's what's causing this, feel free to comment.  I've already checked to see if there was some kind of IRQ conflict with the real-time clock, but that doesn't seem to be the issue.",

I still have quite some time to think about this since the lease on my current car won\'t be up until June of next year.  I bought my 2001 Toyota Echo on a four year lease.  It\'s a pretty good car, but I think I should be able to get an even better car for the same money I paid for that one.  I bought it in June of 2001, and after Sept. 11 that year, with the economy going to crap, there have been TON better deals on cars.  I have still seen deals much better than I remember back when I bought my Echo.\nAnyways, I really am having some trouble deciding what to get.  I am a slacker, so I would like to be prepared once that June \'05 date comes around. I won\'t be able to take my time then as I will need to have a replacement car ready to go.\nI saw my current dream car in pictures of the most recent Detroit Auto Show. The <a href="http://www.autointell.net/Events/naias-2004/naias-2004-daily/nissan-actic/naias-2004-highlights-nissan-actic.htm" title="NAIAS 2004 Highlights: Nissan Actic Concept">Nissan Actic</a>.  Though only a concept car, if this came out, it would be pretty cool. Looks a bit different, but it\'s kinda like something you might see in a movie of the future, like A.I..\nHere are a few highlight\'s about this car that I like:\n<blockquote><p>"The IT system boasts a 100-gigabyte memory and a portable wireless hard drive. The LCD roof panels provide the ability to use visual displays to change the &#8220;interior environment.&#8221; The Actic is the future contained in a rounded silver pod."<br />\n<i>From <a href="http://www2.naias.com/main.asp?sectionID=256" title="North American International Auto Show">North American International Auto Show website.</a></i></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>"Actic provides nearly unlimited opportunities for its users to explore and challenge the relationship between exterior and interior environments and to introduce elements of personalization by projecting video displays on a series of six roof-mounted flat LCD screens."<br />\n<i>From <a href="http://www.autointell.net/Events/naias-2004/naias-2004-daily/nissan-actic/naias-2004-highlights-nissan-actic.htm" title="NAIAS 2004 Highlights: Nissan Actic Concept">NAIAS 2004 Highlights: Nissan Actic Concept.</a></i></p></blockquote>\nOther than that, there are a few other cars currently on the market that I am looking at.  I have kind of been thinking about the \'modern stationwagon\' look of the Toyota Matrix and the Pontiac Vibe. I would probably go with the Pontiac though as my Dad works for GM and I get a discount for buying those cars.  Another car that I like is the Mazda3.  It\'s a sporty looking car with some nice features.  I have also somewhat considered the Saturn Ion (another GM car) but I still have to look more into that.  My mother-in-law just bought a brand new Hyundai, but not sure what kind.  It was really nice with power everything, a power sunroof, and keyless entry.  They were able to talk the price down to under $12,000.  \nSo far, these are the cars I am considering.  I have also heard some commercials on the radio for Sundance (a somewhat local dealership) having Chevy Malibu\'s for like $190 a month and Grand Prix\'s for $220 a month.  Those are some nice car\'s and for prices like that it might be worth checking out.',

			"On Wednesday I had phone wiring and phone jacks installed in my house.  I have now entered 19th century technology. ;)\nI have been living in my current place for about two and a half years, and bought it new.  Never had any phone jacks, and when moving I decided that I would try the wireless only phone option.  So for the last two and a half years, a cell phone has been my only telephone.\nThere were a few things behind that decision. I already had a cell phone that I never really used at the time.  I bought it because I was driving a hour one way to school three days a week.  I wanted a way to call in case of something happening.  Of course I never did need it.  But, I was paying about $30 a month for that, then another $50 for my landline.  I then realized that I could by a plan with two cell phone for $70.  Cheaper and then Nickcole and I could still stay in touch.  To top that, at the time, MCI was my phone carrier.  But, they didn't have the ability to move my service.  I would have to switch my service to SBC (was known as Ameritech at that time).  After they moved my service, I could then switch back to MCI.  Plus, all the costs of installing the jacks, wiring and hooking up the service, it wasn't worth it.\nFast forward to today.  I have a child.  Nickcole always forgets to charge her phone.  I worry something will happen and there will be no way to get in touch with 911 or anybody for that matter. I also am planning on getting DirecTV once they get local channels in my area.  Should be ready within the next few months.  DirecTV requires a phone line to operate.  I now work for a phone company.  I get a really nice deal on the phone service, so there is really no reason not to have one anymore.\nSo in an era of computers, satellite TV and worldwide Internet, I now have a landline phone. :)",

Fellow ClieSource member CliePet was able to accomplish an amazing task.  He figured out a way to access the high quality audio system that is built in to the OS5 Clies.\n<i>Here\'s some history.</i>  The NX, NZ, and TG series of Clies all have Palm OS5.  OS5 has a built in CD quality audio API.  Sony choose to remove it and include there own audio system.  Problem is, only two apps can access the CD quality audio.  The built-in MP3 player and built-in video player.  Other than that, all you could do is have the old style beeps and blips, or you could do 8-bit 8kHz mono sound. Not to great for trying to playback MP3\'s or watch videos when CD audio is 16-bit 44kHz stereo sound. Newer Clies don\'t have this limitation any more, but Sony would never revel how developers could access the sound on the older OS5 Clie like the one I have (NX60).\n<i>Now, back to today.</i> CliePet, using the same magic he has for other projects like this, not only figured out how to access the audio, but created his own API known as MCA (Modern Clie Audio) and modeled it after the PalmOS5 streaming sound API.  What this means is that any developer only needs to make a minor change in their apps to support this.  The developers of MMPlayer have been the first one\'s to do so only days after this has been released.\n<a href="http://mmplayer.com/MMPlayer0.2.9MCA.zip" title="MMPlayer 0.2.9 w/ MCA support">This is the download</a> for the experimental beta version of MMPlayer with MCA support.  I have tested it on my NX60 and am very impressed.  I took a Divx movie, and do zero audio conversion.  I did convert the video bitrate down as the player doesn\'t handle high bitrates due to CPU limitation of the Clie.  But, the sound was crystal clear.  Unlike previous tests where the sound was very rough and sometimes hard to make out what was going on.  On a 128MB MS, it\'s unlikely a full movie will fit and still have high quality audio.  But, for people with 256MB, and larger MS\'s, not only can you fit full high quality videos on your PDA, you can now have high quality audio.  This really opens the door to mobile movies on the older Clies since it can now play any Divx movie that will work on any other Palm or Pocket PC. Also to note, MMPlayer also know supports a variety of video formats including MPEG1,2,4,H263, DivX and MJpeg. Also limited MOV support.  I haven\'t had a chance to test any of that yet though.',

			'Google has announced a new service called <a href="http://www.google.com/gmail/help/about.html" title="About GMail">GMail.</a>  I have to wonder if this is some strange April Fools joke, or if this is a serious service they are offering.  I remember reading not too long ago that Google had registered some domain names such as googlemail.com.  I think I saw that at <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot.</a>  But that lead some people to believe that Google had some kind of mail service up their sleeve.  But, if what they are offering is true, it could eliminate Hotmail and Yahoo as mail providers.  It would also make me question how Google is able to provide this with only text ads.\nThe main thing that is shocking, is that GMail is a 1GB e-mail account.  1GB of storage space. They estimate it will store about 500,000 pages of messages.  The idea is, instead of trying to constantly delete messages to stay within the smaller limitations of other services, you save all your e-mail and never even need to organize it. Then use Google\'s search technology to find messages that have info that you need.\nSo far, this is still in limited beta testing, you can\'t sign up for an account yet.  But once this gets up and going, Google is going to shake up yet another web industry.  First, they showed up that searching could actually produce results that we wanted without all the junk and deadlinks, and now they will show us a new understanding of webmail.',

			"I have went and ordered a DirectTV/Tivo combo unit.  It is being delivered today, and the installer is even going to come out and install it the same day.  It's a 35 hour unit.  The Tivo's with the DirecTV reciever built in are probably the nicest one's you can get.  If you add a regular Tivo to a digital cable box, or to a satellite system, the receivers get the digital video that is already compressed and converts it to analog to go to the TV.  But then it goes into the Tivo and is converted back into digital and is recompressed.  Then it goes right back out as an analog signal to the TV. The degrades the signal.  Plus, a digital cable box can only output a single channel at a time, so there is no way for the Tivo to record anything while you are watching TV.",

Plus, a digital cable box can only output a single channel at a time, so there is no way for the Tivo to record anything while you are watching TV.\nThe DirecTV/Tivo combo unit receives the digital signal from the satellite and stores it as is on the hard drive.  So all recorded shows are the exact same quality as any other show your would watch.  Plus, the unit has two satellite inputs, so that means that youcan watch one show while another is recording, record two different shows at the same time, and even record two shows while watching a previously recorded show.\nAll I can say is I am pretty excited about getting this installed.  Plus, Nickcole and I decided that we will get HBO again.  Right now we have no movie channels.  I love Curb Your Enthusiasm and can't wait to watch it on a regular basis.\nI also have to say that so far I am pretty impressed with the service I have recieved.  I ordered this on Monday, and on Tuesday the unit was already on the UPS truck, and on Wednesday the installer was setting up an appointment to install on Thursday afternoon, only hours after UPS drops the dish off.\nIf anyone is in the market for a Tivo, you can get one for free right now at <a href=\"http://www.rapidsatellite.com/a.asp?rapidsat&4940\" title=\"Rapid Satellite \">Rapid Satellite </a>.  That's where I got mine.  You get the free Tivo, dish, installation.  You also get a free gift after like three months.  Mostly some crappy stuff, but there is a DVD player, so I am going to get that.  I had to pay a little though, since I also got a second receiver for another TV and I got the multi satellite dish.  That is required to get local channels in some area's (like mine in the upcoming months).  It is also required for Spanish programming and HDTV.  There are a few smaller niche channels that also require that satellite.  Probably a good idea to get since newer stuff will be put on the newer satellites that only that dish can pick up.\nBut, it's a pretty good deal either way.  Have to go to work now, hope the day goes by quick since I can't wait to get home. :)",

It was kind of cool actually because earlier we were so slow they let over half of the tech support staff on break to go outside and play some football and Frisbee.  Very strange to just let everyone stop working and go outside.  We were all worried that when we came back to work, there would be a huge amount of calls on hold, but there were none.

They said   they would be there between 9 and 11.  12:30, almost 1 they finally show.  I was supposed to get this installed first thing since the installation didn't take place on Friday like it was supposed to. Plus they told me the installation was going to be real quick.  I was already assuming it would take about an hour, but after they said that, I thought it would be even quicker.  Two and a half hours was what they meant by quick.\nBut, it's all in, I have DirecTV in the bedroom, and the DirecTV in the living room with the Tivo receiver.  I will have to give a more detailed opinion later since during the time of writing this we got a bit busier at work, and now it's about time for me to go home.",

			"Back in early December, I purchased the Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0.  It's a great wireless mouse.

			"Back in early December, I purchased the Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0.  It's a great wireless mouse.  Does have all the buttons all over it like their Explorer mice, but it does have the standard two buttons plus a scroll wheel that not only scrolls up and down, but can rock left and right providing a full range of page scrolling. \nThis is my first wireless mouse, and the one thing that concerned me was battery life.  If I had to keep replacing the batteries, I was likely not to use it much.  The box said it would last six months on a pair of AA's.  That isn't bad at all, only twice a year.  But, I didn't actually expect it to last that long. For one thing, I do use the mouse quite a bit, probably more than average use.  Plus, this mouse doesn't have an off button, it is always on.  So, I figured that they gave the six month figure as the best you can expect under some rare circumstance. Well, I have now had the mouse for five months, and the battery indicator is still in the good range.  Looks like I will probably get the six months usage that I was promised. \nAnyone loking for a good mouse might want to consider this.  It's optical, so accuracy and no maintenance are nice (If you don't have an optical mouse, you need to upgrade to one, even if it's a cheap one).  Plus, the scroll wheel is very smooth, on other mice you can usually hear the clicks as you turn the wheel, this mouse is silent.  It even looks stylish too.  And you can beat not having a cord.",

This can work like the message rules found in Microsoft\'s e-mail clients, but instead of definite rules, you move certain types of messages to certain folders, and the client learns.  There is also a rules feature still present.</li>\n<li>Favicon\'s actually show up in the bookmarks menu like IE does.</li>\n<li>Spell check ability.  Requires a free add-on program to use.</li>\n<li>Menus have been reorganized to be more similar to IE.  Not really more useful, probably to make the IE-to-Opera transition easier for new users.</li>\n<li>Added smiles to messages in IRC and e-mail.</li>\n<li>Better way to organize contacts.</li>\n<li>Easier access to Hotlist (which is called something else now, I think it\'s just called the panel.</li>\n<li>Much easier way to customize toolbars.</li>\n</ul>',

			'This site is powered by a very nice piece of software called <a href="http://www.movabletype.org" title="Movable Type Publishing Platform">Movable Type</a>.  Big news has been that the next major release of the software, version 3.0 is in the testing stages and going to be released soon.  Well, that time is now.  \nSix Apart, the company that produces the software has released a developers version of the software that anyone can use right now.  But the big news that has caused a lot of controversy has been the announcement of a <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml" title="Mena\'s Corner: It\'s About Time">new licensing scheme.</a> This is a huge change.  Movable Type in the past has been completely free for noncommercial use. And there will still be a free version now, but it is very restrictive.  It only allows for a single author and up to three blogs. For many, this is too restrictive for how they are currently using the software. Not only that, but the lowest cost version of the software to purchase has a price tag of $99.99, on sale for 69.95 currently. This will allow up to five authors and five blogs, still for noncommerical use. That\'s quite a hefty price.  I understand that the company needs to make money, but for the price to go from free to $100 and still be restrictive compared to what the free version offers is a hard change to transition to.\nPlus, add on to that, version 3.0 will not really add any features expect for their TypeKey comment feature, something that I really had no intrest in anyway. Once again, I have no problem with the fact that this new version wasn\'t going to add any features. The big thing was that the foundation of the application was going to be completely rewritten to allow for better plug-ins and more powerful features in the future.\nI believe that a fully-featured version of Movable Type would be something worth paying for.  Throw in every feature they can think of, and slap a price tag on it.  But, 3.0 is basically just like 2.6, but it costs money. So, for the time being, I am planning no software upgrades and will stick with what I\'ve got.',

But then, I get a nice little call from Nickcole at work.  She sounded all panicky. She said there was a tornado warning and the sirens were going off.  I didn't even hear the sirens.  And they just put a new one up near Wal-Mart which is about a half mile from my house.  But, the storm was pretty loud, I had to shut all the windows because I couldn't hear the TV over it. So, I think the rain muffled out the siren noise.  So, here I am with an 11 month old, and me who wasn't even fully dressed in a mobile home with no basement. I rush to get clothes on, threw some shoes on, grabbed a blanket, a diaper bag, and Hailey.  Ran out the door and into the car.  Hailey and I were soaked since I didn't take any time to find coats and couldn't get the blanket on Hailey all the way.  But, if there was a tornado on the way, getting wet isn't the end of the world.",

Didn't even have any details on where the tornado was to try and avoid it.  But I headed for the highway since that was close by and could get us out of the  way as quick as possible.  But as I start going, Nickcole's mom calls.  She says I should head for my sister in law, Tarra's, house.  I then turn around and head for that direction.  As I am going that way, I get a call from Tarra asking where I am since the radio says that the tornado is near Packard Highway, the road our house is on.  Also, this is the road I am driving on. Not very good, so I increase speed. Anyhow, I finally make it to Tarra's and all is well.  But, the flooding was unbelievable. Nearly every street corner I came to in town was completely flooded, some roads I don't think were drivable.  Plus all the ditches on the Packard, which is on the edge of town, were completely full of water.  I had no yard when I got out of the house, it was a lake.",

Think of the children, and the parents, and the poor, and the older.

With the news of <a href="http://www.cbulock.com/archives/000424.html" title="Sony to Stop Producing Clie\'s">Sony suspending the Clie</a> line, it was decided that something would need to be done with the Cliesource website as it would die eventually.  Cliesource has been running since December of 2001 and I became a member there back in October of 2002.  In October of 2003, Cliesource spun off a new site for PalmOne devices called <a href="http://www.palmonecity.com" title="PalmOneCity">PalmOneCity</a>.  I think the big reason for this was due to the release of the PalmOne Tungsten T|3 handheld.  This was PalmOne\'s big comeback device and many Clie users switched over to it.\nWith the Clie line ending, it was decided that combining the communities of Cliesource and PalmOneCity into one would be a great idea.  Not only that, the site now supports all PalmOS based devices, so there are now forums for the <a href="http://www.1src.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=125">Tapwave Zodiac</a>, the <a href="http://www.1src.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=123">Garmin iQue</a>, and also the <a href="http://www.1src.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=126">Samsung</a>, <a href="http://www.1src.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=130">AlphaSmart</a> and <a href="http://www.1src.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=127">Kyocera</a> devices.\nNot only are the sites combining, other things are being changed too.  For one thing, the forums have been streamlined.  That are now less topics to wade through to try and find a thread you are looking for.  For example, Apps, Launchers, and Games have all been combined into just Applications.  They are all technically applications and are all related.  There are still separate forums for the newer Clie lines, but all older Clie devices now have just one combined forum.\nAlso, the software powering the forums has been updated to the vBulletin 3.01 from a much older version.  This means that there are nice features such as drop down menus and basically a much cleaner look.  The cleaner look isn\'t just in the forums either. The front page is now much simpler, though currently I find the font much to small to read.\nBut, there is still a lot missing from this new combined site.  Reggie did an amazing job throwing this all together at the last minute.  I don\'t think he slept at all during the Memorial Day weekend. He even took Tuesday off work to finish readying the site since it was planned to be finished by midnight of the 31st, just in time for the big Clie announcement. \nBut, for anyone who hasn\'t already done so, make sure to check out the new <a href="http://www.1src.com/" title="1src - The One Source for all things Palm-powered related.">1SRC</a> site and if you have any suggestions or comments, post them <a href="http://www.1src.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55907" title="Suggestions for 1SRC">here.</a>',

So, I am out in the open with all my spelling incompetense for everyone to see. \nBut, I have been learning alot about PHP recently.  It's kind of my new thing to learn.  I don't know why I haven't learned it before.  It's so simple, very much like BASIC.  I love programming in BASIC, but it's pretty outdated now.  I have tried and failed very much at C++, so I never tried Java, and Perl just scares me.  I did have a time when I was doing some Visual Basic programming, but that has passed.  Web pages have been what I like working with recently, and I really like using Movable Type.  But, it's a static system.  PHP can make the pages more dynamic.  Maybe soon I will find some good uses for this knowledge.  I have already put it too good use by helping with the backend of managing this website.\nWell, time to go home now.",

Going to a website to retrieve my mail seems like extra steps I wouldn't want to take.  Maybe I will figure out some use for this account though.  I mean, it does have a gig of storage.  I was thinking, it would be great if I could upload all of my currently archived e-mail from my PC to the GMail service.  I have all my e-mail back to 2000 stored in my Opera browser right now.  If I could upload all that (it's certainly not a gigabyte of e-mail even though it's been accumulating over a number of years), I could then use the nice search and organizing features that GMail offers. If I could start now and be able to use that will all of my current e-mail, maybe then I would find that GMail has a lot to offer for e-mail organization.",

			'<p>This is an issue that I have been pondering for a little while.  How could permalinks in Movable Type be changed.  By definition, permalinks should be permanent. But, what if all those all links still worked while at the same time completely redoing the URL scheme.<br />\nBTW, assume I am talking about the Apache webserver unless I mention otherwise since that is what I am using. <br /></p>\n\n<p>There are a couple ways this could be done. For instance, if the filename is generally going to stay the same, say, changing from http://www.yourwebsite.com/archives/000255.html to http://www.yourwebsite.com/blog/entries/page0255.php then you could write a single rewrite rule in your .htaccess file that would handle that.  I know very little how to do this, but with the knowledge it should be fairly simple.<br /></p>\n\n<p>But, I want to move my files from the default /archives/000001.html scheme that is setup to a more natural and organized /year/month/page_title.html.  The problem is every page title is unique and only Movable Type would know what those are and what the year and month is for the posts.  Had I known more about Movable Type before I started my website, then I probably would have gotten this right to begin with, but it was much more fun to jump into it and learn as I go.<br /></p>\n\n<p>So, what I have come up with was this.  Create a new index template that will generate Apache redirect commands that can be placed into a .htaccess file.  The template code will be in this format:<br /></p>\n\n<code>&lt;MTArchiveList&gt;<br />\n&lt;MTEntries&gt;<br />\nRedirect permanent <i><span class="mark1">[Current Archive Path]</span><span class="mark2">[Current Archive File Template]</span></i>&lt;/MTEntries&gt; &lt;$MTBlogURL$&gt;<i><span class="mark1">[New Archive File Path, if any]</span><span class="mark2">[New Archive File Template]\n</span></i>&lt;/MTArchiveList&gt;<br /></code>\n\n<p>Basically, the same tags used to create the master archive page, but modified to output the \'Redirect permanent\' statement that the .htaccess file in Apache uses to redirect the pages, then the path to the old names using the default archive scheme, then followed by the new scheme. This of course could be modified to whatever current archive format you are currently using followed by the new format you will be changing to.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Here is how my code looked:<br /></p>\n\n<code>&lt;MTArchiveList&gt;<br />\n&lt;MTEntries&gt;<br />\nRedirect permanent <span class="mark1">/archives/</span><span class="mark2">&lt;$MTEntryID pad="1"$&gt;.html&lt;/MTEntries&gt;</span> &lt;$MTBlogURL$&gt;<span class="mark2">&lt;$MTArchiveDate format="%Y/%m/"$&gt;&lt;$MTArchiveTitle dirify="1"$&gt;.html\n</span>&lt;/MTArchiveList&gt;<br /></code>\n\n<p>One thing to notice though, for this to come out right, you will want to use the MTArchive tags, but when you edit the Archive File Templates in your Movable Type system, you will need to use MTEntry tags. <br />\nSo, my Archive File Template will look like:</p>\n<code>&lt;$MTEntryDate format="%Y/%m/"$&gt;&lt;$MTEntryTitle dirify="1"$&gt;.html</code>\n<p>If you have never changed the Archive File Templates, you can do this my going to the Movable Type Control Panel, then going into the \'Weblog Config\' and clicking on the \'Archiving\' link. I am changing the Individual archive template here, so in the box that says \'Archive File Template\' is where the changes would need to go. <br />\nYou might also want to change the archive URL on the \'Core Setup\' section of the weblog config. That is what I have listed in the <span class="mark1">this color</span>.  My original archive URL was http://www.cbulock.com/archives, so all the archives were behind that.  My new setup just has http://www.cbulock.com as the archive URL since I just wanted the archives to be organized my year and month, but still having an archive URL is okay, it just has to be considered when changing this all around. Also, make sure to be careful of any other archive file templates you might have if you change the archive URL, since they will also need to be changed.  I forgot about this at first and it messed up my mobile version of the site.<br /></p>\n\n<p>All that needs to be done now is for the template containing the code above to be built.  The outputted file will contain all the redirects that can be pasted into an existing .htaccess file.  If you don\'t already have a .htaccess file, you could probably even have Movable Type directly output it.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The other method I had would have a similar effect, and this could be done using any webserver since the redirection is done on the visitors end and not on the server.  You can use a Meta Refresh.  If your not familiar with this, a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=meta+redirects" title="Google Search: meta redirects">Google search</a> will give a lot of info.  The main thing is the META tag as shown below in <span class="mark3">this color.</span> This tells the browser what page to redirect to and how long to wait.  By having content=0, this will happen immediately. But, since some browsers won\'t automatically change the page, you can also put a direct link in the actual page content.  If I was to use this method, I would want to set up a new individual archive template with the following code:<br /></p>\n\n<code>&lt;html&gt;<br />\n&lt;head&gt; <br />\n&lt;title&gt;&lt;$MTBlogName$&gt;: &lt;$MTEntryTitle$&gt;&lt;/title&gt; \n<span class="mark3">&lt;META http-equiv="refresh" content="0;</span>URL=&lt;$MTBlogURL$&gt;<span class="mark2">&lt;$MTArchiveDate format="%Y/%m/"$&gt;&lt;$MTArchiveTitle dirify="1"$&gt;.html</span>"<span class="mark3">&gt;<br />\n</span>&lt;/head&gt; <br />\nThis page has been moved.<br />\n&lt;a href="&lt;$MTBlogURL$&gt;<span class="mark2">&lt;$MTArchiveDate format="%Y/%m/"$&gt;&lt;$MTArchiveTitle dirify="1"$&gt;.html</span>"&gt;If not automatically redirected, please click here.&lt;/a&gt; <br />\n&lt;/body&gt; <br />\n&lt;/html&gt; <br /></code>\n\n<p>Then, as long as this new individual archive was set up to build with the same settings as the old files, Movable Type will rebuild this template over your old files.<br /></p>\n\n<p>I had to decide what I wanted to do, use .htaccess redirects, or meta redirects.  The problem with .htaccess redirects is that every page that loads on the server now has to go through that file.  So I am not certain how bad that impacts the server by adding hundreds of redirects to it.  But, with meta redirects, you have to first load the redirect page, then load the new page. Plus, this can be somewhat sloppy since this is done client-side, so if the page doesn\'t redirect, the visitor has to manually do so, and it makes the site look amateurish. The final factor that made my decision was <a href="http://www.netmechanic.com/news/vol4/promo_no15.htm" title="META Refresh And Search Engines">this page about META refreshes.</a> After reading that, I decided the Apache .htaccess redirects were the way to go.</p>',

I have only tried the Opera conversion, so I can\'t say if converting from other apps works fine, but it\'s worth a shot.\nDoing this in Opera was a cinch since it already has mail sorted by different categories.  It was as simple as exporting each folder I wanted, then having each convert separately in the MBS-toMBX app. Then I uploaded each MBX file one at a time and applied labels to each group of messages and then archived them.  Then I would simply upload the next group and do the same thing. I also made sure and try and set up as many filters as possible ahead of time so mail would automatically be organized.\nOne thing about GMail, it has some features that are similar to Opera\'s M2 client.  Like having multiple labels per message.  Opera also allows messages to have multiple labels, and is very useful for some messages.\nWhat is the main feature that GMail needs to get soon?  Learning filters.  Opera supposedly has this feature now in it\'s latest version, but I haven\'t tried it since I have been using an app <a href="http://popfile.sourceforge.net/" title="POPFile - Automatic Email Classification">POPFile</a>.  The main reason I started to use POPFile was for it\'s spam blocking.  It learns what messages are spam, and is able to adapt in the future. At first this does require a training period where you have to classify messages and spam or not, but it learns very quickly.  And the longer you use it, the better it gets.  This is why I never switched to Opera\'s learning feature since POPFile was 99.6% accurate.  But, it doesn\'t just work with spam.  It\'s good for just organizing your email.  For instance, I read a lot of forums.  I like receiving e-mails when posts I have posted in are responded to. So, I have a folder in my email for those messages.  Before, everytime I would join a forum, I would set up a new filter for messages from that forum.  But, with POPFile, it would just know that it was a forum response message and always classify it as such, even if it was the first message from that forum.\nIf Google was able to add a learning feature like that to labels, I would be a happy person.',

Not a big deal as most programs work with this format, but Opera doesn't export to CSV.\nFortunately, there is a web-based tool that will convert Opera's format to CSV format. <a href=\"http://www.hallvord.com/opera/adr2tab.htm\" title=\"Address book conversion: ADR to TAB or CSV-separated\">Address book conversion: ADR to TAB or CSV-separated</a> will convert the .ADR Opera address book format to CSV or tab separated files.  What you need to do is either locate where your address book is located on your hard drive, like the site mentions, or even easier, just go to the File Menu and choose File-->Export-->Opera contacts.  Then save the contact list somewhere (probably not a bad idea to have a backup anyway).  Then upload the file to that site, choose 'Comma seperated' then click 'Send File'.  You will be prompted to save a .php file.  Save that, then rename it to something.csv.\nBut, GMail won't take this file exactly as it comes.  One little edit needs to be made. If you view GMail's info on <a href=\"http://gmail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=8301\" title=\"How do I import addresses into my Contacts list? \">how to import contacts</a>, you will see that the CSV file needs to have a header, which isn't included when you convert using the website above.  Don't worry, this step is simple.  Just open the CSV file in your favorite spreadsheet app, like Excel, or my favorite, OpenOffice.org.  Then add a row to the beginning of the file.  The first column should say 'Name' and the second column should say 'Email Address'.\nThen simply save, go to GMail, open your contacts, then click 'Import Contacts' and upload this CSV file.  Much easier than adding all those by hand, unless you only know two or three people.",

			'The <a href="http://www.jackito-pda.com/" title="The first Fingertip-Touchscreen PDA">Jackito</a> is a device that has been announced at a number of websites.  One such news story was this one at <a href="http://www.brighthand.com/article/Jackito_Tactile_Digital_Assistant_Announced" title="First Tactile Digital Assistant Announced">Brighthand</a>.\nThis device is not a PDA as the company that makes it says.  It\'s a \'TDA\', Tactile Digital Assistant.  Why is this?  You don\'t use a stylus, you use your oily fingers to touch the screen.  The website for this product has a lot of good to say, such as "7 parallel processors" and all kinds of features such as a color screen, high-sound quality, wireless capabilities and weeks or use on a single AA battery. \nBut, is it a lot of talk, or is there any truth behind this greatness?\n\nSo I investigated.  First, a trip to the <a href="http://www.jackito-pda.com/buy_it/buy_it.php" title="Shopping cart">pricing</a>.  The base unit, <b>$600</b>.  Oh, but you wanted color?  Not included, an extra $138.  And what about the wireless capabilities? Also, not included.  Bluetooth, an extra $80, WiFi, another $150 on top of that.  Would you like a camera, add on another $100.\n\nSo, just for a decent PDA, and by that I mean color screen and WiFi, this device is already going to cost <b>$888</b>. For that price, surely this thing must be powerful.\nHow much RAM is there? 2.5MB.  Yes, that\'s not 256MB, that\'s 2.5MB, or about 2500KB.  Don\'t worry, they do throw in 14MB of NOR Flash memory so you can store your apps and things somewhere.  That is, if anyone makes any apps for it.\n\nMust have a good sound system since it\'s advertised to have "high-quality sound".  To start with, the MP3 function, which is also not included, will cost an extra $45.  But, they do offer an FM radio, for $30.  So, what kind of speaker is built in? From the webpage: "LCD loudspeaker 100Hz-10KHz - 0.1 Watts".  Very low range, and a tenth of a watt??  Plus, I have no idea what an LCD loudspeaker is, almost sounds like the LCD screen is the speaker. This was a bit too strange for me, so I didn\'t feel like researching that any further.  They do mention that you can buy headphones for $20, or a Bluetooth headphone for $100.  I just hope they have a standard 3.5mm minijack so normal headphones can be plugged in. I wouldn\'t be surprised if this was some proprietary jack they use forcing you to buy there headphones.\n\nHmm, so what about the "7 processors".  This raises a number of thoughts.\n<ul>\n<li>Won\'t it be hard for developers to program for seven processors?</li>\n<li>How can a single AA battery last \'several months\' powering all those processors?</li>\n<li>With such little RAM, why so much processing power?</li>\n<li>Is this even for real?</li></ul>\n\nThe main CPU is a Mitsubishi CPU (M30803) and from what I can find, that tops out at 20MHz.\nThe other "CPU" mentioned is the <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/MSP430" title="MSP430">Texas Instruments CPU (MSP 430),</a> a 50 cent processor that, while it has low power consumption, doesn\'t seem to be all to powerful. Couldn\'t find any specs other that it\'s a 16-bit processor. Seems that it\'s mainly used to perform simple tasks such as controlling an LCD screen.\n\nThe other "CPU\'s" mentioned are simply programmable logic chips probably also used to control other simple functions on the device such as sound and video.\n\nSo, there are just a number of simple microchips all performing basic tasks to power this device.  Every PDA or computer has a number of chips that back up the main CPU to perform tasks.  These are never mentioned, but at the same time, if your main CPU is only 20MHz, you certainly can\'t advertise that either.\n\nSo, for $600, you are getting a device that, hardware-wise, competes with the $20 PDA\'s found next to the calculators at Wal-Mart.  The only thing that this device has going for it is the \'no-stylus\' marketing gimmick.\n\nAlso, during the reading of the discussion at Brighthand about their news artice, Ed Hardy mentioned Roland Piquepaille\'s site.  He had an <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0105910/2004/07/21.html#a912" title="Exclusive Interview With Jackito\'s Makers">interview with the maker\'s of the Jackito.</a> Somewhat interesting, but didn\'t really touch on any of the issues I brought up here.  It does have a video of the device.  I would have to say the software doesn\'t look all that bad.  But time will tell this devices fate.  And I don\'t think time will play nicely.',

Not a bad deal at all.  There has been a lot of talk of possible compatibility problems after installing SP2.  I wouldn\'t worry too much about it.  Really, the only difference externally is the new firewall and security center.  By default, they really bug you if your security isn\'t up to par.  I actually like the fact that the firewall is automatically turned on.  I made sure to promptly turn off the firewall and virus protection monitoring.  But the average person would never worry about these things until there computer is messed up and they call tech support.  Now they have a nag. :)',

The mini taskbar player is one feature that makes it easy to watch movies and still not have the movies take up the entire screen.Previously, if you wanted to change place in your movie while using this, you have to open up the full window, then adjust the seek.  Now, moving your cursor over the window will display a little seek bar.  It's still hard to make small adjustments since the window is pretty small, but it's better than nothing.\nThere is also a radio feature now.  I love listening to Internet radio, used to use Winamp for this purpose, now just iTunes, but maybe I can just use WMP now.  I haven't really tried this out too much yet, but it's great they finally added this.",

Within the first minute of a support call, not only do you learn what the issue the customer is having, but at the same time you are learning the experience level of the customer.  This is important since this is how you know how to explain to these customers how to fix their issue over the phone.  There is a large difference in the experience level of computer users, but the average user just knows enough to get to the certain thing they want to do.\n<blockquote><p>Most Web users don't know what a browser is. That blue E they click on the desktop isn't a browser, it's \"The Internet.\" Or maybe it's \"Yahoo\" if that's what their home page is set to.</p></blockquote>\nThis is so true, it's actually very sad.  Some calls, it can be a bit tricky to figure out what browser and mail client a customer is using.  If you ask how they view webpages, the response is \"I click on the Internet\", or \"I open that thing and Yahoo comes up\".\nBut, what does this really have to do with anything?  Most people are just so accustomed to doing things a certain way, they don't understand there is another way to do things.  Many people have been using the Internet regularly for five years or more, and many of these same people have never changed the way they do things this whole time.  For many people, this means Internet Explorer is \"The Internet\".  But, I also deal with a lot of customers who still use Netscape version 4.7x.  Why is this?  Back in the late '90's, Corecomm and some of the other smaller ISP's it bought up would send out CD's to customers that would install Netscape as the default browser.  These people are either still using those same computers, or they just used the same CD to set everything back up on their new computers and have never changed a single thing.  For these people, Netscape is \"The Internet\".\nSo, how are these people going to switch over to a new browser?  For these people, that means a 'new Internet'.  One might think that those people could just be discounted and ignored, but not only do they make up a good number of people using the Internet, but they are also the ones with the least knowledge about how to stay safe and could use the features offered in alternate browsers such as Firefox.\nSo, would I recommend Firefox?  Actually, I have on a couple of occasions.   There are a few things to consider.  It isn't a finished product.  And it isn't quite ready for the nontechnically inclined.  But, sometimes customers will call and inquire about alternate browsers.  You can tell if they understand the differences and if someone is familiar with computers and software, Firefox is a fairly good piece of software. Of course I prefer to use Opera, Firefox is a good stepping stone away from IE.  It's just not quite as polished in some aspects as Internet Explorer when it comes to new users and does quite have everything it takes to become \"The Internet\".",

Is going to be selling for $199.82 and has a release date of 11/30/04 (my birthday).  I\'m sure all these details have been out for a while now, but I haven\'t really been following closly. Some things that impress me:\n\n<ul>\n<li>"If software developers desire, multiple players can compete in wireless games, even if only one person has a game card inserted. Players could also test-play games for themselves as long as they stayed connected."</li>\n<li>"With the newly developed graphics engine, DS can reproduce impressive 3-D renderings that can surpass images displayed on the Nintendo 64. Games will run at 60 frames per second, and allow details like fog effects and cel shading."</li>\n<li> For its compact cards, the unit uses newly developed semiconductor memory, which allows for lower cost, shorter manufacturing time and memory capacity of more than one gigabit of information.</li>\n<li>Nintendo DS makes a vast library of Game Boy Advance games readily available. Developers could find ways to make new connections between GBA games and DS games.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIt\'s probably smart for Nintendo to do this soon as I imagine the PSP isn\'t going to be too far off.  When I saw the PSP, I figured Nintendo was done for if they didn\'t have something up their sleave because it totally blows away the GBA.\nBut with the superior 3D capability than the Nintendo 64, this could hold up quite the competition.  Nintendo does have a lot of support from developers for their mobile game platform since they have been the king for the past 15 years.  Plus, the system is backward compatible with a 15 year gaming library.  PSP vs. Nintendo DS could get very interesting soon.',

		entry_excerpt:
			"Once again I am trying my traditional attempt to switch from Opera to Firefox.  Why is this a tradition now?  It seems every time there is an update to Firefox, everyone goes on and on about how great it is and I attempt to try it out, only to be disappointed in the end.  I think the disappointment isn't all of Firefox's fault.  Some of it is that it doesn't quite have the power of Opera at first test, and at the same time it just wasn't what I was familiar with.\nSome things have changed though.  I now use Firefox daily at work.  So, I am now pretty familiar with the subtle differences in Firefox.  But there are still so many things that I take for granted in Opera that aren't found in the standard default Firefox install.  In the past I have tried to supplement this with the many extensions that are available. I think I have now found the right combination.",

I think the disappointment isn\'t all of Firefox\'s fault.  Some of it is that it doesn\'t quite have the power of Opera at first test, and at the same time it just wasn\'t what I was familiar with.\nSome things have changed though.  I now use Firefox daily at work.  So, I am now pretty familiar with the subtle differences in Firefox.  But there are still so many things that I take for granted in Opera that aren\'t found in the standard default Firefox install.  In the past I have tried to supplement this with the many extensions that are available. I think I have now found the right combination.\nSo far, I have installed the following extensions to get Opera-like functionality:\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/_tabextensions.html.en">Tabbrowser Extensions</a>, this was absolutely necessary, provides endless customizations for the tab features, greatly surpassing anything Opera can do.  The default tab features are Firefox are way too basic.</li>\n<li><a href="https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=12&vid=741">All-in-One Gestures</a>, gestures are one the the great features of Opera.  I am a mouse guy, and gestures allow most features of browsing to be done with quick swipes of the mouse.  This extension probably outdoes the Opera implementation.</li>\n<li><a href="http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=245&vid=611">Translate Page</a>, though not a built-in feature of Opera, Opera is very customizable through INI files, so I was able to add in this feature in myself.  It\'s always nice to be able to translate foreign pages on the fly.</li>\n<li><a href="http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=65&vid=69&category=">Paste and Go</a>, allows right-clicking in the address bar and pasting the address and opening it with one click.</li>\n<li><a href="http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=89&vid=101&category=">Allow Right-Click</a>, doesn\'t allow Javascripts to take over the right-click context menu.</li>\n<li><a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/wmlbrowser">WMLBrowser</a>, to view WML (WAP) pages</li>\n</ul>\nI have also installed some other extensions to make my experience more enjoyable.  I have the <a href="http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=173">Gmail Notifier</a>, <a href="http://editcss.mozdev.org/">EditCSS</a> and <a href="http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=10">AdBlock</a>.  \nGmail Notifier is something that is not really needed since I am also using the offical notifier from Google that sits in the system tray, but I figured I would try this one out also since I might like it better.\nEditCSS is great for editting webpages.  I still am pretty novice with CSS and make a lot of mistakes and it takes me a LOT of trial and error to get pages to look the way I want.  Since EditCSS always realtime viewing of CSS changes, it speeds that process up a lot faster.  On my other computer, this was the only reason I kept Firefox installed was for the EditCSS extension.\nAdBlock is a pretty interesting extension.  Works pretty good too.  I normally am not against advertising on webpages. (Well, expect for pop-ups/pop-unders, I have no problem blocking those)  It\'s a necessity and the web wouldn\'t exist as it is today without ads. Pages have to make money somehow.  But, I have always had trouble with Tribalfusion ads at <a href="http://www.1src.com" title="1SRC">1SRC</a>.  They don\'t load properly too often and it\'s real annoying.  And, recently they have been using a lot of Flash ads, and at 1SRC, the ads are placed right under the nav menu.  But, of course, the menu goes behind the ad, so if there is a Flash ad on the page, you can\'t use the nav menu very easily.  So, if ads are making a page unusable, I will be blocking them.\nAt this point, I think I am pretty happy with how things are going.  I figured out how to set it up with the Tabbrowser extensions to save the open tabs when closing Firefox and have them reopen next time.  This was one of the things that I didn\'t want to lose from Opera as I normally have tons of tabs open and I never get to everything at one time, so I need to have the browser come back next time I open it up.\nAlso, the Tabbrowser extensions have the ability to open previously closed tabs.  This feature hasn\'t been in Opera for too long, I think it might have been introduced in version 7, but it\'s nice to have.  Accidentally close a tab, and you can have it back with no trouble.\nI think this might be the final test and I may actually switch over this time.  Opera is a great browser, but I think it\'s best days are past.  Firefox will likely improve at a faster and faster rate, and it is quickly becoming a standard.  I don\'t think Opera will be able to hold on to it\'s user base for the price that it charges for it\'s desktop app if there is a free app as good as Firefox.',

But I wasn't getting an error though either when using that code, just nothing was outputting, so I might have to research the error a bit more.  It's more than likely some minor mistype on my part somewhere.\nOne thing I realized.  Movable Type needs some way to do a complete import and export.  It was easy to export and import the actual entries themselves.  The templates on the other hand were a PITA.  Unfortuantly I decided to make everything on this page in little pieces, so I have a good 25 or more templates.  Fortuantly they are all linked to a file so I just needed to create the templates and copy over the links to the template files.  Still was not simple though as I also have to reset up the preferences and the archive file templates.  At least I could copy this info from my current version 2.661 install. If I had to set this all back up from scrath, I would be screwed.  I have backups of all the entries and templates, but that isn't quite enough.\nBut, after installing all that, I had to move on to the plug-ins.  I went through and found out which ones I was using, then had to investigate any possible conflicts MT3.  The only one that seemed to have an issue was the Rebuild plugin that could rebuild pages set using a crontab.  It seems there are likley easier ways to do this now in MT3 since the backgrounds task feature is built in and there are ways that plugins can do tasks using crontabs.  Also, there might be a SQL plugin issue, but can't verify that yet.\nSo, if anybody finds any issues with anything, please <a href=\"http://www.cbulock.com/contact_me.html\">contact me</a>.  I have spent a lot of time today trying to make sure this was a smooth transition, but I have no doubt I missed something somewhere.",

For my own personal note-taking and to share what I have installed, here are the current patches:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>4x4 icons v3</li>\n<li>Call Block/Rejector</li>\n<li>Call Duration in Call Log</li>\n<li>Character Counter</li>\n<li>Default to Month View</li>\n<li>Enable Add/Delete Pages</li>\n<li>Enable Forwarding</li>\n<li>Enable Landscape Email</li>\n<li>Enable Vibration</li>\n<li>Hide Nascar App</li>\n<li>Hide NFL App</li>\n<li>Just Charge By Default</li>\n<li>Lower Swap Threshold</li>\n<li>Match State to Area Code</li>\n<li>Reduce Minimum Brightness</li>\n<li>Show Wifi SSID</li>\n<li>Sound Toggle - Grey</li>\n<li>Unhide Dev Mode Icon</li>\n<li>Unthrottle Download Manager</li>\n<li>Virtual Keyboard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A lot of this stuff is indeed included in other phones by default, and I will admit that webOS is lacking in some features.  Thankfully, the hacking community is really great and they have made the phone very nice.</p>\n\n<p>Also, anyone running Preware should probably make the following modification to the phone. This will stop updates from occurring automatically.  It's possible that you could really mess up the phone if you install an OS update over all the patches, so it's best to have control over the updates instead of letting Palm do them automatically.  What this does is simply remove the execute ability from the update application.  You need to have root access to do this.  Once you are logged on as root, run the following:</p>\n\n<pre>\nmount -o remount,rw /\nchmod -x /usr/bin/UpdateDaemon\nmount -o remount,ro /\nkillall UpdateDaemon\n</pre>\n\n<p>Then, on days like today when once you've removed all the patches, you can reverse this and re-enable the updater by doing the following:</p>\n\n<pre>\nmount -o remount,rw /\nchmod +x /usr/bin/UpdateDaemon\nmount -o remount,ro /\n</pre>\n\n<p>Then restart the phone.</p>",

It no longer uses the built-in Movable Type search and runs off of <a href="http://depository.unfoldedorigami.com/php/bettersearch.phpx" title="Slightly Better Search for Movable Type">this script.</a>\nBut, if you have a supported browser, simply click in the search box and start typing.  Your results will appear instantly in real time without loading any new pages.\nI am still working out some minor details on how the results are displayed.  For instance, if you press the Search but o the enter key to load the results, I haven\'t got any CSS on that page yet, so the results are just plain text.  But if anyone has any comments or suggestions, please feel free to post them here, or to <a href="http://www.cbulock.com/contact_me.html" title="Contact Me">send them to me personally</a>.  I would like to make this as good as possible and I don\'t always have the best design sense.  I am fairly pleased with how everything is running so far though.',

I this was a big step as I upgraded them to the <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery2</a> software.  This is the same software that it was running before, but version 2 is a complete rewrite, and is much improved in a number of ways.  There aren\'t any new pictures yet, I have a couple I need to upload. I just got finished setting up the pictures so they still randomly display over on the right hand side of the page.  This was somewhat easier then before as Gallery2 was a built in random picture module, and a way to use it externally.  But, the URL rewrite module was not giving the correct URL\'s for the pictures.  Also, there was just a lot of extra HTML in the built in random picture module.  But I cleaned that all up and it\'s now mostly how I want it.  I may do a few more tweaks still.',

			"I have just completed nearly a week with limited personal computer usage.  I am still using a computer all the time at work, but we have been so busy that I never have any free time to just surf and do personal things.  Execpt for tonight.  We finally aren't busy.<br />But, at home, I have been using a laptop because I am never able to just sit in my office and use the computer.  I have kids to watch.  So, the laptop is great.  But, the thing stopped charging right a couple months ago.  Seems the AC jack was not connected to the motherboard very well.  At first, you just had to jiggle the cord a bit, and the connection would be fine, and it would charge.  Then it kept getting harder and harder to do.  Eventually, getting the cord in the exact spot required over five minutes of tugging the cord in different directions to get it in the exact spot so it would charge.  And then, the slightest bump, and you would lose it.  Then, sometimes it just wouldn't charge at all if the machine was on.  It would stop charging the second the power button turned on, and then start again the second the machine turned off.  I took the machine in to Circuit City where I bought it and tested it on their AC adaptor so I could see if it was a problem with the cord.  Had the same trouble there too.  Called Toshiba, and the guy I spoke made it seem like a common thing.  Can't remember, but I think he might have even said that it happened a lot with the motherboards.  But, he seemed pretty familiar with it and said the motherboard needed to be replaced.  So, for the last week, the machine has been at a repair shop.  They said it would take 5-10 days since they would have to order the part and replace it.  Too bad it's not a desktop and I could have just fixed it myself. <br />So, for the time being, I am holding on.  I am getting way behind on reading my RSS feeds.  I hardly have time to read my e-mail.  And work on my site has almost come to a halt.  I did put some new code in the other night at work that let's me tweak certain things per post.  Like I can turn off ads in indivdual posts, or even make the ads bigger.  I plan on adding other 'per post' tweaks, maybe that's what I will do later tonight.  I have had a lot of free time today.  I just had a 12 minute gap between my last two calls, and the last call was only a minute long.<br />\n",

		entry_excerpt:
			"Now, I'll start by saying I am not real big on watching children's movies. But, there are a few I do like such as the Lion King and Shrek. But, Saturday night after work, Nickcole and I decided to go to the movies. There wasn't really any outstanding movies playing, but I noticed that there was a 3D version of the Polar Express playing at the IMAX theater. I have never been the IMAX as it has mostly had movies that I haven't wanted to see. And anything I did want to see was just a normal movie blown up for the bigger screen. But, based on the previews, I knew the Polar Express had some pretty impressive animations, and to see it in 3D would make it worthwhile to pay the extra charge for going to the IMAX.",

But, based on the previews, I knew the Polar Express had some pretty impressive animations, and to see it in 3D would make it worthwhile to pay the extra charge for going to the IMAX.  Now, this wasn't cheap. At the Celebration Cinema in Lansing, it was $12 a ticket for adults.  But, it was definitely worth it.  I could not only believe how good they made the characters look in the movie, but the 3D was sooooo good.  Every little detail was 3D.  I was afraid it was going to be something where the 3D was an afterthought and they just had some parts where it looked good, but I am certain that the movie was made with the 3D in mind.  Some scenes such as the roller coaster type ride seemed so real.  It almost felt like you were really on a roller coaster.  The snow looked like it was coming down in the theater.  And a couple scenes where there were flybys of train were impressive.<br />If you just want to see this movie, watch it in a normal theater, if you want to experience this movie, watch it in the IMAX.\n",

So, it would be very easy to use Movable Type and instantly publish not only to a website, but also auto generate MSWord files and Adobe PDF files.\nAnyhow, maybe I will write up a quick tutorial on how I did the PDF setup.  It\'s fairly simple, only requires Movable Type and PHP.',

I\'m paying about $45 a month for this and the lite service only offers 128k down and 64k up.  It\'s nothing great, but somewhat better than dialup and is always on. I am switching to DSL soon, but I need a new phone jack installing in the office, and since I am no electrician, I will be hiring someone to do this.  I am going to wait until after Christmas once the finances are more stable.\nBut, yesterday, or maybe the day before, all of a sudden, downloads seemed so much faster.  I just downloaded some podcasts, such as the new <a href="http://www.1src.com/?m=show&id=706" title="1SRC Podcasts by Jeff Kirvin">1src podcast</a>, and that 5MB file just zipped down to my computer.  So I decided to run some speed tests.  <a href="http://www.mdm.net" title="Millennium Digital Media">MDM</a> has a <a href="http://speedtest.cablespeedmi.com/" title="Cablespeed Speed Test">speed test</a> on their site, so I figured that would provide me with the highest possible speed.  I ran that a couple months ago and got a reading of 140k.  Today I got 377k. Awesome.  So, I then went to <a href="http://www.dslreports.com" title="broadband > The clearing house for high-speed industry gossip">DSL Reports</a> to get a more \'real life\' reading since their test servers are located across the country in California.  Before I got a reading of 122k down and 60k up from there.  Today I got 354k down and 116k up.\nNot sure what happened, I never got any word from MDM about increasing the speed, and their website doesn\'t mention anything.  I actually even called them up and asked if they had any chance of increasing the speed anytime soon, and they said they did not.\nWhatever is up, I am very happy.  Hope this is not just a fluke and will stay this way.',

At $39 a license, it seems pretty silly to pay for multiple copies for different machines around the house and for different OS\'s.  Nothing technically prevented using the same key on another copy of the same OS, which is nice since I have gone through three computers since first buying Opera.  But, now I can install it on other machines in my house, including my Linux machine.  That is a pretty good deal.  Too bad they specifically say desktop OS though, since it would really rock if my current license key could also work on my Series 60 smartphone.',

And by that, I guess I was expecting the same type of depth that was available in games such as SimCity and SimEarth, but playable through all the stages from cell to space.

			"Here is my initial review of the game Spore.  I bought this game the day it came out as I was majorly excited about its release.  To give a quick summery of the game right off the bat, I'm fairly disappointed.  But, I have more to say than just that.\nMainly, I guess I was expecting a more \"SimEverything\" type game, which I believe was actually one of the original titles given to the game.  And by that, I guess I was expecting the same type of depth that was available in games such as SimCity and SimEarth, but playable through all the stages from cell to space.  Instead, this game plays like five different games, but watered-down versions of the games.  With the time that was spent making the game, I was hoping for so much more.\nFor a background on where this review is coming from, SimCity is probably my favorite game series of all time.  I own all the real SimCity titles(SimCity - SimCity 4, the Societies one is a bastard and does not count).  I would have to say that SimCity 2000 is probably my favorite, but I would probably like Sim City 4 the best if I ever owned a computer that was able to play it once the city grew really large.  I may get back into that game in another 5 years or so.  I am also a big fan of SimEarth and loved the control that game allowed over planetary development.\nAs for my Spore background, I have played the game up to the space stage.  Other reviews seem to indicate that the space stage is the best part of the game, but I have only just started it, so it will not be included in this review.  I will say however, if other reviews are true, Maxis should have just made this game to be a space simulator and with the creature creator, they shouldn't have wasted time with all the other stages as it seems it was just put in there so the game would live up to what they have been talking about doing for years.\nThe first stage you play is the cell stage.  There is little that gets done here.  You either eat meat, which is just randomly floating around for no apparent reason, or you eat plants.  There is little skill involved.  The only thing this stage really does is introduce you to customizing your creature and getting items.  The items are what you build your cell out of, and these are gained by killing other cells and other times they just randomly appear.  I'm not really certain at all how this level is in any way supposed to be a simulation.\nAfter that you move on to the creature stage.  There is one really cool part about this stage, designing the creature.  There actually seemed to be a lot of work done with this as it's super easy to add parts and manipulate your creature into looking just how you want.  I will say that this part is actually fun.  Then again, I could have just bought that part of the game for $10 as it went on sale before Spore came out.  The big problem with this stage though, is that it just drags on.  There isn't a whole lot you can do, either make friends, or attack people.  Actually, it seems that all this entire game is about.  There isn't really a whole lot of skill to this level.  If you want to make friends with people, you have to get allies to follow you around, but that sucks cause they die so easily.  Then you have to keep going back to their villages and picking them back up.  Otherwise, you can just fight everyone.  And you don't really need allies for that.  I found the best way is to just get someone to chase you so that they leave their village area, then you can fight them one on one.  Repeat this about 5 times or so and you destroyed that creature completely.\nAfter the creature stage, you move on to the tribe stage.  This part is so boring and I didn't like it one bit.  It has the same exact elements as the creature stage, either make friends with tribes, or destroy them.  But, making the buildings was lame and the outfits were boring.  You can get full level 5 on all your stats after the first or second tribe you destroy or friend.  Additionally, they changed how the camera controls work compared with the creature stage.  The controls make it seem like you switched to playing a different game, yet, the game itself is almost exactly the same.  If I were to make Spore, I think I would have made this part of the game to be very similar to Age of Empires.  No exact defined area where you are settled.  Much more in depth on gathering supplies and such. The only difference I guess would be the possibility to make friends with the other tribes instead of just destroying them like AoE. Of course, the destruction would still be possible and probably most fun.\nAfter tribe stage is civilization stage.  This part is a blatant rip off of the game Civilization.  Civilization is yet another favorite game of mine.  I do like the fact that Spore is real time though as opposed to being turn-based. But, beyond that, it's mostly a very simplified version of Civ. The only unique thing really is that you can design the buildings which is pretty cool.  I wouldn't be surprised to see that feature in a later version of Civ. They could have at least made it as detailed and as fun as Civ.  Regardless, this part of the game seemed somewhat fun.  There was some depth, such as cites could be economic or military based.  The lame part of this level was how quick it was.  I completed it in less than an hour.  I would have liked to get more into this part of the game.\nI just started to get into the space stage, which is the final part of the game.  The flying training was actually pretty sweet, there is lots of fun things to do such as abduct beings and shoot lasers.  I will have to post another review once I play this stage more.\nOverall, this is probably a game I would have been much better off just downloading off bittorrent and playing for a couple days.  I don't think I'd really recommend buying it.  It's probably much more enjoyable to either buy Civ4 if you don't have it, or it you do, just pull it out of your archives and play that again.",

We were kind of afraid that maybe he had been laying down too much, but since he has a pretty big head (his head size in the top 90 percentile), he didn't like to sit up, because it was hard to hold his head up.  He is doing a real good job holding it up now, but that has just been in the last couple of weeks.  Dr. Randall, his doctor, didn't seemed too concerned about it, but said we could have him see a neurologist to have him look over the situation as he might need a corrective helment to make his head grow properly.\nAmazingly, they were able to get us in the next day, so today we seen the neurologist.  He thinks there could another issue.  He said that it's possible that the bones in his head aren't fusing together properly and weren't growing the way they should be.  He said that a flat spot can sometimes be caused by lying down in one spot, but what normally happens is that the ears won't be even on each side as one side will grow differently. So, he wants Brett to have some tests done as he won't be certain without those.\nI know Nickcole is really nervous about this, but even I am a little bit.  He wants Brett to have a CAT scan done on his brain to make sure it's growing properly and to make sure things are connected.  I don't remember the exact wording he used.  Then, he also wants a 3D CAT scan done on his skull.  This is going to be something that will start around noon, the first test will be at 1:30, and the second test will be at 3:30.  The whole time they will have to put Brett under anesthesia since he can't move.  I've never gone under full anesthesia in my entire life, and he is only four months old.\nBut, hopefully, if there is some problem, we can catch it soon and get it fixed.  Otherwise, at least we will know that he is fine.",

I just got done posting about what I had installed, which is good as I now have a good source to go to reinstall them.  But, I have actually been running most of these for a long time. It's been about <a href=\"http://www.cbulock.com/2004/09/switching_from_opera_to_firefox.html\" title=\"Switching from Opera to Firefox\">six months</a> since I have been soley using Firefox, and I quickly started to pile up all the useful extensions that it has.\nToday, two of my extensions had updates, one was ForecastFox, I can't remember the other.  I installed both as normal, but then later in the day I noticed more ads than I was used to.  Some really annoying ones. As I went to go use the great Adblock extension to get rid of them, I noticed that it wasn't there.  So, I check the extension list, and it was showing.  Checked settings.  Was enabled.  Closed out of Firefox and restarted it to see if that did anything.  One thing it did was instead of bringing up my previously loaded tabs, it brought up my homepage.  So, Adblock was still not working, and it seems that Sessionsaver wasn't working either.  At this point I was irritaed, so I tried to 'deinstall' the Adblock extension. (Most extensions you can just uninstall from the list, this one has a deinstall option, so I tried that).  Needless to say, I could go on and on about how everything went downhill after that.  But, now I hve the extension list working, none of the extension work now though, and I can't access any options.  Fortunatly all my bookmarks are still there.  When I get home, I will have to work at cleaning all the extensions out of my profile and try to reinstall.  Sounds like a pain. I have long feared that all these extensions would eventually topple over, and it seems that it's possible for that to happen.",

			'Finished all the coding for my new site image system.  This was mostly completed last weekend, I had to integrate some of the other code from this site into it, like the stylesheet system.  Now, I have an easy to use web interface for uploading images, it will create automatic thumbnails and favorite icons for all the images.  I can then easily add the images to my site using PHP.  It will then insert either the full image, or a thumbnail with a link to a preview page containing the full image.  I did this for a couple reasons.  For one, I never had to think about HTML when dealing with images on my site.  Also, I never had to deal with using Irfanview to resize images before uploading.  A bonus, since 90% of the traffic here comes from Google and MSN image searches, I can better control my revenue from that.  I plan on some future enhancements such as auto watermarking images that are being hotlinked.',

			"Had the last four days off at Corecomm.  Was a nice break.  Now I am back working again though.  Family was somewhat sick this weekend.  That was a bummer as the weather and everything was really nice.  Hailey had a constant running nose and was sleeping alot, Brett was coming down with the same thing too.  Nickcole thinks she might have had strep throat or something.  I was feeling fine, but tired.\nThe great thing that happened this weekend though, I went out and bought a PSP.  I got Twisted Metal: Head On along with it.  It is completely awesome.  Not that I had any doubts that it wouldn't be.  If anyone else here has Twisted Metal for the PSP, my screenname online is cbulock.\nFew things, everyone was afraid of the battery life.  I was playing online for a real long time.  At least an hour, maybe close to two hours.  And I still had over 80% of my battery left and I think the PSP said there was still three hours of gameplay left.  I have no consern at all about the battery life anymore.  Sure, it's no GBA SP (I have probably charged that five times since I've owned it), but still good. \nAlso, the included earphones ain't that bad.  I hate those things, they never stay in my ears and the sound is ususally bad.  But, I liked the ones that came with the PSP.  They fit right, and sound tons better than the built in speakers on the unit.  The PSP speakers sound like the speakers found on a cell.  But the quality through the earphones is amazing.  More on the PSP later.",

			"My next car may be the Scion xA.  I had a test drive of this car on Saturday.  I like it a lot.  Drives almost exactly like my Toyota Echo, yet with a bit more kick to it.  This likely due to the fact that it's running the same engine and under the hood it's pretty similar to my Echo.  But, it has a smarter system that makes it drive a bit better, though the gas mileage is quite as good as the Echo.  Still not bad though.  I have been looking at a number of cars recently.  I looked at the Pontiac Vibe, but, while not priced too highly, it's cost more than my current car, as was the priciest of all the cars I have so far looked at.  I then looked at the Chevy Cobalt as I think that looks somewhat stylish and is the latest car from Chevy at a good price.  Looking at the interior, I quickly changed my mind.  Reminded me of a Corsica from the 80's.  Just a really boring and plain interior.  The outside looks nice, but I'm going to be sitting inside that thing for the next few years.  So, that went off the list quickly. While I was at the Chevy dealer, I looked at the Chevy Aveo.  Previously, I had not considered this as it looked way too small. But, looking at the inside, it seemed big enough and actually looked fairly nice inside.  Took that car for a test drive, but the car just could do anything.  I had trouble getting on the highway.  I ended up with the pedal all the way to the floor, and the car not really making any effort to accelerate.  That car is now also off my list.\nThe Scion xA is priced very nicely, even with all the standard features that my Echo doesn't have, such as CD player, power windows and locks, and a clock.  To top that off, I can add a security system, key less entry, side airbags, and a subwoofer, and the car is about $30 a month less than I pay for my Echo.  I currently lease the Echo, but I can buy this car for less.  To top that off, I researched the insurance rates, it looks like the Scion cost less for insurance.\nLike I was mentioning before, I took the Scion for a test drive on Saturday.  I need to get back with the dealer soon as I need to get the order put in for the features that I want.  He said it would take a couple of weeks to have the car ready.  After that, I may actually have the car.  My current lease doesn't end until June 15th, but the dealer said that he would be more than willing to buy out the lease early as it is only around $6300 to buy out the car, and he said due to recent demand for the Echo, he could sell it for $9000.  Of course, he is making out quite nicely, and I would be getting out of my lease early, so everyone wins.  Also funny, when I was taking the test drive, I got pulled over by a cop.  Apparently, the dealer plate fell off of the car.  Was slightly nervous at the time, especially when the cop started asking how did he know we didn't steal the car as there was no plates, registration, or insurance.  The dealer didn't have a good answer and neither did I.  Fortunately, I had his business card on me as the cop asked for that as proof, and the dealer didn't have one on him.\nSo, as of right now, I think I will be going for this car, unless I find a good reason not too within the next week.",

I had to work, but I didn't do much of anything else.  Never extremly sick, just a non-stop cold that wouldn't go away.  I am better now and back to getting things done.  One thing that I have been working on for about the last six months and is nearing completion is a complete rewrite of this website. I have rewriten all the templates powering this site from the ground up.  Using all standards perfect XHTML and CSS to the best of my abitily.  Actually, the research started about nine months ago.  I have been doing a lot of planning on this.  I have a due date set for completion of June 22, which is the 2nd anniversery of Cameron's Thoughts.  I have set a number of deadlines for things to get done, and so far everything is ahead of schedule, so that release date hopefully will actually happen.\nOther than that, not much else going on.  Brett started crawling a few weeks ago, now he is going really good at that.  He can also sit up with no trouble and can pull himself up on things.\nAlso new recently, I did decide on the Scion xA as my next car.  I ordered one and it will be in by the time my current lease is up on June 15th.  Will be a step up from my current vehicle.  It's a pretty similar size and engine and things.  But this vehicle will have a built in Pioneer MP3 CD player with six speakers plus a subwoofer, power windows and locks, remote keyless entry, side airbags.  Pretty much a ton of things my current car does not have.  So, I am pretty excited about that, only a couple weeks to go for that.\nI am going to end this post now though, as I started writing it about six days ago.",

			'I just seen that Google came out with a new <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps" title="Google Sitemaps">Sitemap</a> feature.  This is kind of cool as it allows you to basically tell search engines what pages you have available instead of them just having to find them.  So, I went ahead and setup a sitemap using the <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/docs/en/sitemap-generator.html" title="Installing and executing Sitemap Generator">Python script</a> they have made available.\nTo do this, I simply downloaded the script, copied the sitemap_gen.py to a folder on my server.',

I have a more up to date version found <a href="http://www.cbulock.com/2005/06/sitemaps_-_latest_update.html" title="Sitemaps - Latest Update">here</a></p>\n\n<p>I just seen that Google came out with a new <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps" title="Google Sitemaps">Sitemap</a> feature.  This is kind of cool as it allows you to basically tell search engines what pages you have available instead of them just having to find them.  So, I went ahead and setup a sitemap using the <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/docs/en/sitemap-generator.html" title="Installing and executing Sitemap Generator">Python script</a> they have made available.\nTo do this, I simply downloaded the script, copied the sitemap_gen.py to a folder on my server.  Then I created the following config.xml file and saved it in the same folder:</p>\n\n<code>\n&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;site<br />\n  base_url="http://www.cbulock.com/"<br />\n  store_into="/home/cbulock/public_html/sitemap.xml.gz"<br />\n  verbose="1"<br />\n  &gt;<br />\n\t<br />\n  &lt;urllist  path="urllist.txt"  encoding="UTF-8"  /&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;/site&gt;\n</code>\n\n<p>What this does is looks for a urllist.txt file that contains all the URL\'s for the map.  It then outputs a sitemap.xml.gz file that search engines (just Google currently) can use.  To create the urllist.txt file, I created a new index template in Movable Type.  The index template simply outputs the urllist.txt file to the same directoryas the sitemap_gen.py and config.xml. This template just outputs all the Individual, Monthly, and Category archive page links.  I also placed a link to my main index page to.  The Movable Type template looks like this:</p>\n\n<code>\nhttp://www.cbulock.com/ changefreq=daily priority=1.0<br />\n<br />\n&lt;MTArchiveList archive_type="Individual"&gt;<br />\n&lt;$MTArchiveLink encode_xml="1"$&gt; lastmod=&lt;$MTArchiveDate format="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"$&gt;&lt;$MTBlogTimezone$&gt; priority=0.8<br />\n&lt;/MTArchiveList&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;MTArchiveList archive_type="Category"&gt;<br />\n&lt;$MTArchiveLink encode_xml="1"$&gt; changefreq=weekly priority=0.7<br />\n&lt;/MTArchiveList&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;MTArchiveList archive_type="Monthly"&gt;<br />\n&lt;$MTArchiveLink encode_xml="1"$&gt; changefreq=monthly priority=0.5<br />\n&lt;/MTArchiveList&gt;\n</code>\n\n<p>The changefreq and priority attributes can be changed.  All the details on how to use those can be found on the <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/docs/en/sitemap-generator.html" title="Installing and executing Sitemap Generator">Sitemap Generator instruction</a> page.</p>\n\n<p>After you have the script uploaded, the config.xml file setup and the urllist.txt outputted by Movable Type, you can then run the script.  This requires telnet or SSH access to your server.  The commands are also listed on Googles instruction page.  I have setup a cron job that runs the script once a day.  And that\'s about all that\'s required to get this up and running.</p>\n\n<p>There is still some more work on the template that I plan on doing.  For instance, I have a number of pages that are generated by a seperate blog.  I will need to add those to the map and also set it up to give the lastmod attribute to every page.  I only spent about 20 minutes on the template so far.  To see my latest updates to the template, <a href="http://www.cbulock.com/templates/Sitemap%20URL%20List" title="Sitemap URL List">here is the latest copy of the template</a> that I am using.</p>',

Today was the next I set for the actual coding to be completed by.  I think everything is all set.  Over the weekend I will be doing final testing and working out any bugs.  Then next week I will transition the new design over to the live server.  I'm pretty excited about all this.  This has been a huge project that I have been working on for a long time.  I am happy for this to be coming to a completion.  This will be a fresh clean and simple design.  The underlying code is standards based and very accessible.  It will be very easy for me to improve in the future also.  All the underlying templates used for this site are completely modular and I can be used over for new additions and upgrades.  Plus, a simple module change will affect all pages, no need to change endless numbers of templates for each minor change.\nMore details will follow, but, get ready for the 22nd.",

I spent hours going over all the code and going through my database to try and find a reason, couldn\'t figure it out.  So, instead, I decided to set the Livesearch to work with the built-in Movable Type search instead.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, you will still want to follow the <a href="http://blog.bitflux.ch/wiki/LiveSearch#Installation" title="LiveSearch">installation instructions</a> to get the HTML setup on your page and the Javascript setup.  There\'s going to be one change to the livesearch.js file I will mention later.</p>\n\n<p>To setup a search template, you will need to upload a new file to the search_templates folder of your MT install.  The file should be named livesearch.tmpl.  Here is what the file should contain:</p>\n\n<code>\n&lt;MTSearchResults&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;MTBlogResultHeader&gt;<br />\n&lt;strong&gt;SEARCH&lt;/strong&gt; : Results for "&lt;$MTSearchString$&gt;"<br />\n&lt;ul class="LSRes"&gt;<br />\n&lt;/MTBlogResultHeader&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;li class="LSRow"&gt;<br />\n&lt;a href="&lt;$MTEntryLink$&gt;"&gt;&lt;$MTEntryTitle$&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br />\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;!--LSRow--&gt;<br />\n&lt;/MTSearchResults&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;MTNoSearchResults&gt;<br />\n&lt;ul class="LSRes"&gt;<br />\n&lt;li class="LSRow"&gt;<br />\nNo results for "&lt;$MTSearchString$&gt;"<br />\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;!--LSRow--&gt;<br />\n&lt;/MTNoSearchResults&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;!--LSRes--&gt;\n</code>\n\n<p>The next thing you will want to do is open your mt.cfg file and add the line "AltTemplate ls livesearch.tmpl" without the quotes.  This will tell Movable Type to use this search template and gives it an ID of "ls".\nNow all you will need to do is edit the livescript.js file.  You will need to look for <code>liveSearchReq.open("GET", liveSearchRoot + "/livesearch.php?q=" + document.forms.searchform.q.value + liveSearchParams);</code> and replace it with <code>liveSearchReq.open("GET", liveSearchRoot + "/mt/mt-search.cgi?SearchElement=both&amp;SearchCutoff=99999&amp;MaxResults=10&amp;Template=ls&amp;search=" + escape(document.forms.searchform.q.value));</code></p>\n<p>You may need to adjust that line so it points to your mt-search.cgi script.  Also, the SearchElement=both can be changed to SearchElement=entries if you don\'t want comments included in your search and the MaxResults can be what you would like.</p>\n\n<p>Once you\'ve done this, you should be all set to go using Livesearch on your Movable Type-based site.</p>',

			"Next week I will be on vacation, so if you leave me any emails I won't be responding, and if you comment and this site and get the message that it was moderated, then it might take some time before it shows up.  Right now, I am sitting here with 15 minutes left to go at work before I have the next nine days off.  I am excited.  This is the first time I have gone on a trip since I went to Cedar Point back in 2001.  The last time I went camping was my honeymoon back in 2000.  Our family is going up north to Higgins Lake to go camping.  I bet Hailey is going to have a blast because she is addicted to being outside now, and she will be able to do that all day long now.\nBut, before I go on vacation, tomorrow I am spending the day with Patrick.  I am pretty excited about that too.  We haven't done anything together for more than a couple of hours here and there in a long time.  But, tomorrow we are getting tuxes for his wedding, and then we are going to golf.  Something I have never done in real life.  I have been playing Hot Shots Golf on the PSP non-stop recently, but I imagine the real thing is a bit different.  \nAnyhow, my night is now done at work. Yay!  Here comes my vacation!",

Or at least learn how to customize to the way I wanted.\nHe is actually more upset with the "fanboys" now, and not so much as the software itself.  He posted back in March about the <a href="http://blog.fawny.org/2005/02/01/opera/" title="Opera for Macintosh: Not exactly magnum">Opera 8 beta</a>.  I posted <a href="http://www.suplido.com/joel/archives/2005_02.html#000645" title="What\'s wrong with Opera?">a comment on Joel\'s site</a> and I still feel the same way.  Almost everything that Joe mentioned is just the normal software behavior that can simply be ignored (calling tabs windows for instance), or can be customized (keyboard shortcuts).  I haven\'t used Opera on a Mac, but if it\'s anything like the Windows or Linux versions, which I am almost certain it is, you can easily customize all the shortcut by simply going into the preferences. The only reason I really write this is because Joe really came off as some arrogant know-it-all who simply couldn\'t be wrong about anything. And, before I am called some Opera "fanboy", I don\'t even use Opera anymore. I loved it, but have since switched to Firefox.  And not because of the price either, I have a registered copy of Opera, I just love Firefox\'s extensions to much. Ah, whatever.

			"Today I upgraded Movable Type, the software that does much of the work behind the scenes to this site, to version 3.2.  This is still in beta, but is on the 4th and what is likely to be the final beta.  I am very impressed with the update.  To all the people who were bummed when MT3.0 didn't really have any new features, here you go.  MT3.0 was a complete redesign of the software that allowed for what they have now come out with. This is the feature release everyone was waiting for.  I actually disabled MT-Blacklist for the first in a long time and an going to go with just SpamLookup and the new built-in spam security features.  I guess we will see how that goes.  Also, I upgraded to a beta version of MT-Notifier.  That is what is used to subscribe to entries.  It doesn't seem to be working, so I will have to investigate that.  Right now, the subscribe checkbox does nothing, and if you subscribed before, you will not be notified of any new comments.\nOne thing to note, not technically a bug in MT, but they have gotten more picky on templates having valid code.  I tried rebuilding my site and my <a href=\"http://mobile.cbulock.com\">mobile site</a> errored out.  This was actually my fault as I was missing an opening MTEntries tag.  But, that must have been like that for a while and MT never gave me any trouble.    So, if you have sloppy templates, you may find that they don't work like they used to.\nThe only other thing that is bothering me right now, is they have gone back to sans-serif fonts in the  Movable Type control panel.  This is what they had back in MT2, and it seemed to be a nice little improvement.  I usually use HTML-Kit to edit the templates, so it's not a big deal, but most code editing is done with serif fonts, so that seems more natural.  I may edit the Movable Type templates to get the fonts back, but that will be a project for another day.",

I know, I totally suck when it comes to stylesheets and even if I knew what I was doing, I don't really have much of a taste for design anyway.  But, I figured, what the hey.  I spent over six months rebuilding this site earlier this year, I might as well take advantage of some of the things I built into it, like easily swappable stylesheets.  So, I threw together this new theme.  I pretty much just swapped the colors out with red and greens and found a public domain Christmas tree image and threw that in the background.  Maybe I will try to improve on it before Christmas comes around.  Oh, I also added a menu at the top there so you can switch back to the normal stylesheet if this is too distracting. ",

			"I thought, I should do a look back at the past year, and reflect back on it.  This is a bad year to do so though.  If I can say anything about thinking back at 2005, it's that I'm glad it's over and look forward to 2006.\n\nI am normally a pretty positive person.  But, this past year has probably been one of my worst years.  The great thing about really bad years, I probably have only good things to look forward to.  Basically, getting divorced was a pretty stressful thing.  I didn't expect it to go well, but at the same time, I have never felt depression like I did after that happened.  I didn't know that I could feel that bad and have a better grasp on how depression can really affect your life.  I am over that for the most part now, but that lasted longer than I could have imagined.  I normally have pretty good control over my feelings and emotions, and for the first time, I didn't.  To top that off, while I knew my marriage wasn't going well, I didn't quite realize that Nickcole was so easily ready to end it.  I really caught me off guard.  Leading to the divorce, this summer we had some of the worst financial situations we ever had.  I still don't know why we didn't have any money.  But, we were broke.  I went to selling things on Ebay to have gas money.  I was scared for a while and that lead to a lot of stress having to worry about money so much.  And now, my job is no longer guaranteed to last much longer.  It's more of a question of when it will be over with, rather than an if.  I will be laid off sometime soon, be it a month or three months.  And with the current job market, I might have to settle for less pay or something.  It's not making this year end all that well.  That's the general bad crap that I can think of right now.  It's the stuff that has affected me most this year.\n\nLet's see, some of the good things about the past year.  At the beginning of the year, Brett was not quite even three months old.  Now he is running around, starting to talk and becoming quite an energetic little boy.  My job also pays more and has become tons easier. At the same time, while my financial situation at one point this year was the worst it has ever been, I now am only working one job and doing quite well financially.\nKnowledge-wise, I have been learning so much about web design.  I completely rebuilt this site from the ground up.  That was one of the biggest projects of my life.  Seriously.  It took about half a year to complete.  In the process I have learnt about proper xHTML coding, PHP and MySQL databases. I feel pretty confident in using these now and hope that I will be able to do some nice web projects in the near future.\nPeople-wise, being single has changed my social situation quite a bit.  I didn't really talk to my brother much since moving out of my parents house back in 2000, but now we are probably closer than we have ever been.  That's really cool.  Plus, I have started hanging out with Patrick again.  We have been friends for over 15 years, but for the past five or so, we didn't do a whole lot together.  More recently, I have been hanging out with Paul, CJ, and Ben from work.  We've been having LAN parties every couple weeks and that's been fun.  While I have been lacking in relationships with women, hopefully that situation will improve sometime in the future.  So, not everything has been bad.\n\nThat's my quick rundown of 2005. I feel confident that 2006 will be a great year.  My goals for 06 are to start working out and to get a better job.  I don't want to make my goals list too long, or I'll skip things.  As long as I do those two things, I think the rest of everything else I want to get done will kind of just fall in place.  Anyways, happy new year!",

I guess this is the only thing I have a problem with right now, but, when I got a new computer, I don't have any of the rating info, so I have been re-rating all the songs, and this is making it annoying.",

That was just some stuff that wasn't important to the working of the site, but now this site runs a bit more efficently.  If anyone notices bugs with the site, let me know by clicking my contact link.  If it's vital, it should be fixed within a day, minor cosmetic stuff I will eventually get to.

In XP, you could also change some of the settings for this file in the System properties under the 'Advanced' tab and by clicking on 'Settings' under the 'Startup and Recovery' section.</p>\n<p>OK, so when I installed Vista, it created a boot menu, and it had a setup option.  This is normal for even for previous versions of Windows as it has to reboot during the setup process.  In Vista, the timeout is only three seconds, so if you don't want to enter the setup, you have to be quick.  Problem is, Vista blue screened during the install. Seems I have a bad copy.  But, how do I get rid of the boot menu?  I figured it would be as easy as editing the boot.ini file.  Nope.  Here is comment that now showed up at the top of the boot.ini file.</p>\n<pre>\n;\n;Warning: Boot.ini is used on Windows XP and earlier operating systems.\n;Warning: Use BCDEDIT.exe to modify Windows Vista boot options.\n;\n</pre>\n<p>No problem, just got to find the BCDEDIT.exe file.  A search of my drive shows no results though.  Even with hidden and system file scans on.  I assumed it probably wasn't installed yet as the install crashed.  But, tonight I found it.</p>\n<p>Open the command prompt and enter the command</p><pre>cd \"c:\\$WINDOWS.~BT\\Windows\\System32\"</pre> <p>You may need to change the drive letter.

It features a password override so I and a few people there that I trust are able to still gain access.  There could be other uses I imagine.  I had previously setup a system to block only certain entries to my site that had some relation to my job.  I think I will rewrite that code and use it to disable Google caching on those entries.  Seems that some people were getting around my previous block attempts by looking at the Google cache.  I knew this was possible, but I can't think why someone would be snooping around so much.",

We are really short staffed now, but for the first time in about a year and a half, we have some new employees.  It's about time.  So, I will be busy with the training and such with that.  Outside of work, my good friend Neil just graduated from MSU with a degree in political science.  Patrick just bought a house and is all moved in now.  Been spending a lot of time hanging out with Ian, JD, and Kim.  They are a lot of fun to be with.  Also been getting back into playing more video games.  I finally managed to get SimCity 4 installed on my new computer.  It was locking up on the second disk the first couple times I tried to install it.  But, it's on now, and I can finally build as big as cities as I want with no slowdown.  The box says it only requires 128MB of RAM.  Ha, that is a joke.  Maybe to initially start the game.  I have 2GB of RAM, and I can now finally run it.  I also got Counterstrike:Source.  But, now for some reason my DVD burner won't burn a CD, it says no disk in drive.  That is odd, so I shall finish this so I can reboot.",

Probably the biggest updates so far went up last night and tonight.  I have restored the ability to create user accounts.  This went missing since the new site launched.  It was done sloppily with the old site, but I did it right this time.  If you aren't signed in, you should see a Sign Up link in the top left corner. I don't currently use any type of CAPTCHA, but I do filter sign ups using the <a href='http://www.projecthoneypot.org/services_overview.php'>Project Honeypot HTTP blacklist</a>.  I may restore the simple question and answer based CAPTCHA that I had implemented on the old site for the anonymous comment form. The blacklist seems to be pretty effective though.",

A penny was just supposed to represent a certain value, not actually be valued at a penny.  But, technically, a penny is worth more than a penny, since it cost more to make it than it's face value.  Who likes them anyway?  Is it just that people don't want to lose a tradition.  They take up space and are more of a hassle to deal with then they are worth.  Though, they do mention the idea of plastic pennies. If they are going to keep them, they might as well make them out of plastic.</p>",

Religion is another area that I just can't go for.  I could handle middle-of-road people fine.  I don't expect everyone to be a super liberal or anything.  But, if you voted for Bush the second time around, there's obviously something fucked up in your head, and I just can't deal with that shit.\nThese things alone still leave quite a large number of people out there.  But, I'm still just not much of a people person.  I'm not that outgoing when first meeting people, and a lot of people can't seem to handle that.  I've kinda grown contempt for most people in general.  Then there is the intelligence factor.  Probably something that bothers me more than anything is stupid people.  There are just too many of these.  And not to be sexist, but there seems to be a higher percentage of women that fall into this category.  It could just be the ones that I know though.\nI also really value open-mindedness.  I would like to think of myself as extremely open-minded.  I'm not really offended by anything.  Nothing really shocks me too much.  This pretty much is related to why I don't like conservatives.  But, there always seems to be some hangup that people have.  Either they hate homosexuals, or they are racist, or something along those lines.\nThere is also physical aspects.  I am by no means the ideal male when it comes to this, but at the same time I am human and there are traits that I am attracted to in the opposite sex. Unless most guys, I really don't seem to have any preference when it comes to breast size.  I'm not sure why, I think all sizes are nice.  Weight isn't a big hangup for me either.  I do have a thing for a pretty face though.  That seems to be really important. A good smile and nice hair really does me over.  Then there is a height issue.  Being only 5'5\", about half of all women are taller than myself.  I can handle women being slightly taller, but anything more than an inch or so, and I can't really go for that.  This is basically a confidence issue on my part, but that's just the way it is.  The confidence thing may also stem from the fact that on almost all personals sites, women seem to want guys 5'7\" or taller.  Even women that are like 5 foot tall.\nThen, on the rare occasion I do meet someone that I actually can stand and have conversation with, there always seems to be a problem.  Once again, the lack of confidence that I have always makes me suspect the other person doesn't share the same opinion of me.  This inevitably is usually true, only adding to the confidence issue.  Otherwise, there always seems to be a breakdown of things to talk about.  Maybe I am just not that interesting of a person.  I don't really claim to be interesting.  So, why exactly would someone want anything to do with me?  This is my current conundrum.\nOverall, I don't mind so much.  I'd much rather be single the rest of my life than with the wrong person.  But, I'd much rather be with the right person, than single. Huh.",

I mean it was one thing when Arkansas and Kansas wanted to do it.  Those places are already pretty much out of touch with society.

This guy has been slowly draining my resources and causing me stress and grief.  One problem is the fact that I don't ever realize how much the stress is actually getting to me until the day after I accomplish what I have been procrastinating doing.  I then notice how much of a relief things were.  I do have satisfaction that the stress is gone, but I wonder how much better things would be if it was just never there.  I also have to wonder how much my life is being shortened by needless stress that I bring on to myself.  There's of course always going to be stress, but probably a majority of it is self-inflected. I wasn't really going anywhere with this, this has just been going through my mind today.",

I did finally get around to building in a feature to allow myself to send picture messages from my phone and have them post straight to this site.\nOne big news item recently is that I finally moved out of my dad's place that I had been living for the last year since my divorce and got a new place with my friend Brian.  It's a big three bedroom townhouse in south Lansing.  I really appreciated my dad letting me stay with him, but I just have to do my own thing and being 25 living with my parents doesn't do a lot of good for self esteem.\nSo, at this point, I'm pretty excited about having my own place.  Things this week haven't been going so well for me, but I have a feeling that for the most part only good can happen from here on out.  I also have been looking into going back to school. I got registered at LCC and will probably talk to a counselor there I know about getting financial aid and getting a course plan.  Anyway, that's all I have to say for now.",

At 6am I awoke and went to the bathroom with stomach pains.  I then ended up throwing up and feeling much better afterwards.  I was hoping I just ate some bad food and that was that.  I then remembered Nickcole said that my son Brett was sick Tuesday night and threw up every 15 minutes all night long.  \nI went back to lay down.  Then the stomach pains returned.  From 6am on, I went on a cycle of throwing up, feeling better for 10 minutes, feeling horrible stomach pain for about 20 minutes, then throwing up again.  This was my day.  Both Hailey and Brett were over for the night, so I had to utilize those 10 minute intervals where I felt okay to feed and clothe them.  I was eventually able to get ahold of Nickcole and she came and picked them up around 10:30.  I was still sick at this point though.  When Nickcole came over, she also let me know that she came down with the same thing, and was sick every 15 minutes from like 8pm 'til 6am on Thursday night. I knew I couldn't work like this.  Since I am point supervisor tonight, I have to actually find another supervisor to work for me.  This leaves three other people.  First guy I called was up north at Houghton Lake for the weekend.  Next two guys went straight to voicemail.  No return calls or anything.\nSo, here I am at work.  Thankfully, the puking actually did stop at about 12:30.  I still don't feel well. Had only 2 hours of sleep. Haven't eaten anything.  And I'm at Corecomm, which makes me feel unwell on a normal day.",

At the same time, I can't be responsible if this trashes your database.</p>\n\n<p>This code is released under the <a href='http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt'>LGPL</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/info.txt'>Basic documentation</a></p>\n\n<p>Releases:<br />\n<br />\n<a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/1.11/dataadmin.class'>11/11/2007 1.11</a><br />\nNew auto_output function.  Creating interfaces is never easier now.  Literally no HTML is required now. Added delete button to edit pages. Corrected bug in 1.10 that broke the 'No' button when confirming deletions.\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/1.10/dataadmin.class'>07/31/2007 1.10</a><br />\nAdded support to connect to database through class allowing easily switching between multiple databases and no need for your own connection code. Also added the subdispcol info.  Added support for a password field that will store passwords using a hash.<br />\n<br />\n<a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/1.09/dataadmin.class'>07/02/2007 1.09</a><br />\nAdded populate function to replace the populate select function.  populate takes an additional value to populate both radio or select inputs. populateRadio function was also added as an alias to the populate function, added $id variable so any column can be used for IDs.  Added 'where' SQL ability to the populate functions.<br />\n<br />\n<a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/1.08/dataadmin.class'>06/25/2007 1.08</a><br />\nAdded ability to control whether items could be editted<br />\n<br />\n<a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/1.07/dataadmin.class'>07/09/2006 1.07</a><br />\nAdded radio inputs and added label tags in proper places<br />\n<br />\n<a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/1.06/dataadmin.class'>07/01/2006 1.06</a><br />\nAdded populateSelect function to pull data in from other tables<br />\n<br />\n<a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/1.05/dataadmin.class'>06/11/2006 1.05</a><br />\nFixed a bug with the categories involving text encoding and a bug with saving checkbox inputs<br />\n<br />\n<a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/1.04/dataadmin.class'>06/10/2006 1.04</a><br />\nAdded pagination system to item display<br />\n<br />\n<a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/1.03/dataadmin.class'>05/29/2006 1.03</a><br />\nFixed some issues with HTML encoding of the inputs and an issue with the form ids<br />\n<br />\n05/27/2006 1.02<br />\nAdded support for sorting columns either ascending or descending<br />\n<br />\n05/22/2006 1.01<br />\nAdded support for sorting data by certain columns<br />\n<br />\n05/19/2006 1.0<br />\nInital release</p>",

			"Been meaning to write something about this for some time now, but this last week I have been quite out of out.\nLast Saturday Brian and I got around to having a little party at our place. We've been living in this apartment together since the end of January and we decided it was good time to have some people over.  I've been working every weekend for the past year and a half due to a work schedule I agreed to, but I had taken last weekend off.  Thankfully, this is actually going to be the last weekend I work both Saturday and Sunday as I work in a new department at the DPS.\nAnyway, back to last Saturday.  I turned out to be quite a bit of fun.  Brian and I bought some booze for ourselves and made sure everyone else knew it was BYOB.  There really wasn't a whole lot of drinking going on though as many of the people came apparently didn't want to cause they were driving, or they just don't like to.  That was cool though, we had the Wii going, CJ brought over some extra Wiimotes, so we had all four going.  Paul brought over an extra guitar for  Guitar Hero, so we were able to have two-player games of that going.  Jen brought over her blender and we made some damn tasty daiquiris.\nOverall everything seemed to turn out well.  Nothing got destroyed or damaged. No puking went on, which is better than I can say based on events of the night prior when there was only three of us there.  There was about 15 to 20 people that stopped by total.  Sadly I crashed kinda early as I had only 5 hours of sleep on the night before and I was pretty busy much of that day.  I think I might have been coming down with something as the rest of that week didn't really seem to be all that clear to me.  I don't think I really had a clue as to what was going on til about Thursday.\nNow that I have this new job, hopefully we'll be able to plan more events like this.  I think next time we'll have to get some organized drinking games going because there was way to much liquor left over when last Saturday was done.",

Got her a Cinderella cake that she picked out.  Her and Brett had a lot of fun playing all the games at Chuck E Cheese's.  Unfortunately they were the only kids in her group as her friend Hannah couldn't make it.  This did have the added benefit of Nickcole's uncle/boyfriend not making an appearance as I really didn't want to deal with that shit.\nFor the gifts Hailey got, her mom got her a bicycle.  I got her some dresses, a new game for her V.Smile, and an Ariel doll.  She also got some Dora stuff, and some princess dressup stuff amongst other gifts.\nIn other news, this also means that this website has been up and running for 4 years now.  I have some upcoming features I plan to add such as a user login system.\nAlso, I quite ill.  I'm not sure what the deal is or how serious it is and I have no medical insurance, so seeing a doctor is out of the question.  For over a week now I have felt constantly drained of all my energy.  This started one night with an extremely sore belly and suspicions of food poisoning (as my brother who I ate dinner with also got sick). On top of that, I seem to have to work hard to breath and my throat has been sore.  About two days ago I started to taste blood and that has been pretty regular now and hasn't stopped.  Vitamins seem to be no help in this battle.  Hopefully I get better soon.\nThis illness has meant that I have mostly avoided drinking this past week, but I started to feel a little stir-crazy since I hadn't been out doing anything, so I finally went out to the bar on Saturday night.  I think that was a good plan and I felt much better that night at least.",

			"I made a small little update to the <a href='http://www.cbulock.com/dataadmin/'>DataAdmin class</a> today.  This is the first update in close to a year.  All I did was add the ability to set a variable 'editable' to FALSE which then disables being able to click on data to edit it.  This was simply a feature I needed for part of a backend update to this site.  I still have some major changes I plan to make to this class,  probably for a 1.1 version.  The big things I want are the ability to add callback before and after running various processes.  For instance, an image database might need to actually delete the image off the disk after deleting the entry from the database, so a callback could be triggered to handle that.  My image backend on this site basically doesn't allow deleting images for that reason right now.\nThe other feature I want to add is for the class to actually handle taking XML data, performing database controls, then returning XML.  That way apps could be designed however they want and still have full transparency from handling the raw database.  This goes somewhat against the original intentions of this class, which was the ability to quickly develop a frontend to a database with almost no HTML coding, but this will allow more flexibility and sites could use a hybrid of the current setup and one where the HTML code is fully their own.  I also will probably add the ability to have just PHP array variables to be sent back as results and also quite likely JSON to allow for some nice AJAX database controls.\nI'd also even like to allow for a plugin type system where current functions in the class could be extended and added new feature by the outside code, but this would require more PHP knowledge on my end, and I don't really see too much of a new for that.  There are just times when it seems like certain things really don't need to be added to the main class, they could just be patched in for the particular implementation I am using.",

Plus, Monster has real sugar, so it's much better than that HFCS shit that is in Dew and every other pop out there.\nBut, a little over a month ago, I discovered a new flavor of Monster, M-80. It was love at first taste.  It's probably the greatest beverage I have ever tasted.  I just bought two at Quality Dairy since they have the 2 for $3 sale.  I am so happy right now.  If you love Monster, but have not tasted M-80 yet, you must track it down.  Many stores don't have it yet, but it's becoming more and more common.  I first saw it at Speedway, and it seems all Speedway's have it, so that's the place to start looking. It's the greatest tasting Monster, plus it's 80% juice, so it's got a healthy factor to it also.",

Then it stopped for a few months.  I had one a couple weeks ago though.  And then just now.  It's odd that I'm swinging from extreme happiness to these panic attacks where everything seems terrible.\nI think this panic attack may have been brought on by some abdominal pain I've been experiencing.  Not being a doctor myself, I'm having trouble determining what the cause of this is.  Unfortunately, it's on my right side near where my appendix is.  But, it seems to be further right and a little higher than where most diagrams are showing the appendix.  So, I somewhat fear it may be appendicitis.  At the same time, this started when I started doing sit ups, which I hadn't done in years.  So, it may just be a muscle issue.  My reasearch seems to show that appendicitis goes from painful to severe within about 12 hours, and this has been painful for about a week now.  So, I have no idea, but it's certainly not getting any better.",

			"Hey, once again it's been a while since I've posted anything on here.  I seem to have been generally exhausted whenever I am awake, this is probably due to the minimal sleep I have been giving myself.  I actually took a nap yesterday and slept about 9 hours last night, so now I feel great.\nSo, what have I been up to as of late?  I have been playing a fair amount of Texas Hold'em Poker on Facebook. I was doing really great, then I got a bit cocky and went to the really large tables and lost everything.  Last week I bought Guitar Hero 3 for my Wii, that has been fucking awesome.  If anyone else has this game, let me know so we can do some online battles.  I may or not have already mentioned this, but I started a new job a couple months ago.  It's actually a pretty awesome place to work.  It's quite amazing that I can actually go into work and not dread it day after day.  I've been training in the dedicated setups department there the last couple weeks, building and setting up new servers.  Not really sure how I landed that, but it's pretty nice.  Don't have to deal directly with customers, which is the ultimate bonus as the general population of people are not really all that nice to deal with.  Another thing I have been working on in my free time when I'm not drinking is a new web project.  Don't want to give out a lot of details yet, but it's a site mirroring/caching system.  This has been done plenty of times before, but I'm hoping to give a new way of working the backend of it to make it an efficient system.\nAnyway, just thought I'd give a random update.  I have a birthday coming up at the end of the month.  I will need some idea's of how to celebrate this.",

This is the first year both kids sat on his lap.  Hailey did when she was 1, but had been afraid since.  This year, Hailey got scared again as we approached Santa, but Brett ran right up to him and gave him a five, then Hailey got more comfortable.  I decided to get the kids some nice outfits this year for when I take them to the family events.  They also wore them to see Santa.  The kids picked the clothes out themselves, and I'd have to say they have some good taste.  Hailey chose a nice white and red dress with bows and such.  Brett got a nice button-up shirt with a black velvet vest with some pinstripe dress pants.  He looks like a little man in that outfit.  I have a pic of them with Santa, but that will have to wait until I feel like tackling my scanner.\nWe don't have any further Christmas events going on family-wise until the weekend prior to Christmas.  This Friday, my work is doing a holiday party, and in Liquid Web fashion it will likely be over the top, so I am looking forward to that.  There also seems to be a hookah night coming up on Saturday. Those used to be pretty regular, have been happening much less frequently, especially after I left Corecomm.  So, that is another thing that should make this upcoming weekend also be nice.",

All that caused was stress and a feeling of never accomplishing my goals.  My new plan is to live until tomorrow.  So far, it's gone well and I always can be happy to know I've done what I set out to do.  There's been a couple times this last year where I almost didn't quite get to the next day, namely, the very first day of 2007.  But, I'm still here.  On that note, I really have no idea what 2008 will bring.  Leaving Corecomm was really my only thing I really wanted to do last year, and that is done.  I'm loving my current job, so I can't really see leaving it anytime soon.  So, at this point, I'll probably just keep doing what I'm doing and hope things turn out well.

The same one that sadly no longer carries Monster M-80.  I was sick earlier this week, so I wanted to save it for when I was feeling better.  I've been looking forward to drinking this all week.\nYou may or may not know, I love Monster Energy drinks.  The original Monster Energy is a classic, and Monster M-80 is my favorite drink of all time.  I can never get enough of the M-80.  So, I had high hopes for this new Monster as it is also in the \"Energy+Juice\" category like my beloved M-80.  Though, this one is only 30% juice as opposed to 80%.\nI cracked open the can and took a smell.  Bad idea, was gross, yet familiar.  Took a sip. Worse idea.  This stuff is horrid.  I've since taken about 6 sips over the last 20 minutes thinking maybe the taste would grow on me.  It's not.  I have determined it smells kinda like a rum and Coke.  One made with really crappy well rum.\nIf you like Monster or M-80, I'd recommend sticking with those, don't waste your money on this one.  It's exciting to see a new Monster on the shelves, but this one just doesn't live up to the name.  Speedway, please bring back the M-80!!",

It still needs a little work to be perfect, but this did allow comments to come in on my Movable Type 3.2 system.</p>\n\n<p>Here's PHP that took the comments in and submitted them to Movable Type:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&lt;?php\n//Created by Cameron Bulock 07/12/2005 - 09/06/2006\n//Here is my implementation of CommentAPI for use with Movable Type\n\n//URL to MT&#039;s comment CGI\n$comment_url = &#039;domain/comments.cgi&#039;\n\n//Grab the PostID\n$postid = $_GET[&#039;id&#039;];\n//Read in POST data containing the XML\n$input = $GLOBALS[&#039;HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA&#039;];\n\n//Use SimpleXML to parse the input\n$xml = simplexml_load_string($input);\n\n//Format the data to post to MT\n$url = urlencode($xml-&gt;link);\n$entry = urlencode($xml-&gt;description);\n$author = $xml-&gt;author;\n$name = urlencode($xml-&gt;creator);\n\n//This should work, but I haven&#039;t been able to fully test, currently just using $author for the author field, but $creator should be MT&#039;s equivalent to author\n$dc = $xml-&gt;children(&#039;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&#039;);\n$creator = urlencode($dc-&gt;$creator);\n\n//pull email address out of authors field\npreg_match(&quot;/[\\._a-zA-Z0-9-]+@[\\._a-zA-Z0-9-]+/i&quot;, $author, $match);\n$email = $match[0];\n\n$data = &quot;entry_id=&quot;.$postid.&quot;&amp;email=&quot;.$email.&quot;&amp;url=&quot;.$url.&quot;&amp;author=&quot;.urlencode($author).&quot;&amp;text=&quot;.$entry.&quot;&amp;post= Post &quot;;\n\n//Setting up cURL\n$ch = curl_init();\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $comment_url);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 4);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);\n\n//Run cURL\n$process = curl_exec($ch);\ncurl_close($ch);\n\n//Return a &#039;Created&#039; HTTP response.  This is currently just assumed even if not successful\nheader(&#039;HTTP/1.1 201 Created&#039;);\n\n//The server response needs to be reworked and more informative, see: http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg01384.html\n?&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>After you have the code on your site, you also need to update your RSS feed to support CommentAPI.  There are two things that need to be changed.  First, the &lt;RSS&gt; tag needs to have the following added to it:</p>\n\n<pre>\nxmlns:wfw=&quot;http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/&quot;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here's an example of what the full tag will probably look like:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&lt;rss version=&quot;2.0&quot; \nxmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot; \nxmlns:sy=&quot;http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/&quot; xmlns:trackback=&quot;http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/&quot; xmlns:content=&quot;http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/&quot; \nxmlns:wfw=&quot;http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/&quot;\n&gt; \n</pre>\n\n<p>That may or may not be how yours will look, depending on if you use any other namespace extensions to RSS.  Mine actually is quite a bit larger.<br />\nThen, you need to add the following lines inside of the &lt;MTEntries&gt; tag:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&lt;wfw:comment&gt;\n&lt;$MTBlogURL$&gt;comments/post.php?id=&lt;$MTEntryID$&gt;\n&lt;/wfw:comment&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Of course, change the path to whatever you have named your PHP file.</p>\n\n<p>Please be aware, this code is freely available for whatever use you'd like.  Though I have tested and successfully used it myself in a couple different programs that supported CommentAPI, I don't know for a fact that the support is complete.  For one thing, there is no error checking.  Also, the HTTP responses don't fully support all the responses that should be sent. Also, since it uses SimpleXML, PHP5 is required to run this.  There is no guarantees, and I can't be responsible for the code.  I'm just offering this as I planned to release it once it was more complete, but as I am no longer using Movable Type's comment system, I won't be using this anymore and it's may be of some use to someone.</p>",

			"<p>I've made a decision to start a rewrite of this entire site from the ground up. Cameron's Thoughts 3.0 will be the next generation code base that this site will be based on.  I started a <a href='http://www.cbulock.com/ct3/'>wiki to track progress</a> and to record idea's and such.  When I created Cameron's Thoughts 2.0, I didn't have my idea's well organized and it became somewhat troublesome near the end.  I got things together and everything turned out fine, but this project will be way more immense and I have a much better idea of what I am in for now, so I am able to better plan ahead.  The following is my current info taken from the wiki.</p>\n\n<h4>History</h4>\n<p>\n There's a detailed history on Cameron's Thoughts 2.0 changes that happened after it was released at <a href=\"http://www.cbulock.com/about_this_site.html\" title=\"http://www.cbulock.com/about_this_site.html\">Cameron's Thoughts - About This Site</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nBasically, I first started Cameron's Thoughts as a default install of Movable Type on June 22, 2003.  There was a number of changes made to the stylesheet and templates, but that was about it.  I then decided to rewrite all the stylesheets and templates from scratch.\n</p>\n<p>\nThus, Cameron's Thoughts 2.0 was born.  It was about 9 months of work total.  The first few months were basically total research.  This was research into how to properly code to produce 100% valid XHTML, full accessibility and also for search engine optimization.  Really, if you do the first two properly, the third one pretty much falls into place.  I also had to really learn CSS as I only had limited understanding of it at that point. On June 21, 2005, a day before the two year anniversary of my site, Cameron's Thoughts 2.0 was launched.  This was an exciting day for me as it was the completion of a number of months of hard work.  Plus, I actually made a deadline I set for myself. Since the release of Cameron's Thoughts 2.0, I have become very strong at coding with PHP. The initial Cameron's Thoughts 2.0 code had some PHP, but it was limited.  I've released numerous enhancements since, including a fully database backed image system, a user/authentication system, and moved the comments off of Movable Type and onto my own code.  There are tons of other things also added since then, and the site is mostly written in PHP now.\n</p>\n<h4>Problems</h4>\n<p>\nCoding for Cameron's Thoughts 2.0 started in 2004 and fully completed my dream of what I wanted back then.  Four years have since past and the site does not seem perfect as it once did and doesn't live up to my current standards. \n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nSpeed is a major issue with the current site.  On a entry page, it takes an average of 0.93 seconds for the page to load.  This may not seem like a lot, but most other sites will average under 0.2 seconds.  Basically, I feel it's noticeable enough and makes the site feel sluggish on a high speed connection.  I've spent a lot of time optimizing code where I've seen potential to improve things, but from what I can tell, the problem is with the core design of the site and my current efforts have been fruitless.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code Maintenance\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAt this point, the code feels hacked together.  There is limited organization.  Every time a new system is added to the site, it's mostly just been hacked into the current code.  The authentication system is a prime example.  It's one of those things that the site should be designed around, instead it was place on top of everything else.  I feel it's well integrated at this point, but the back of my mind tells me that there is got to be some problem somewhere in the implementation that I'm not seeing as nothing else was coded with it in mind. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modernization\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The site doesn't utilize any modern site features such as Ajax.  And adding these features on would be an immense project.\n</p>\n<h4>Goals</h4>\n<p>\n Here are the basic goals that I have lined up for Cameron's Thoughts 3.0.  I will add more detail in the future. \n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue to use 100% valid code and follow accessibility standards.\n</li>\n<li>Use Ajax to improve user experience.\n</li>\n<li>Make sure any use of Javascript degrades gracefully and is fully separated from the structure.\n</li>\n<li>Move away from Movable Type and use a completely homegrown CMS solution designed specifically for this site.\n</li>\n<li>Develop a caching system that will help combat any high load situations (I have already been working on a caching system for another project that will work well here)\n</li>\n<li>Migrate some of the current system such as the stats, authentication and comments and better integrate them into the new code.\n</li>\n<li>Develop a templating system for the CMS this site will run on.  I have also tinkered with this before.\n</li>\n<li>Possibly create a plugin system so future site enhancements will be easier to add on.\n</li>\n</ul>",

			"My desktop has reached the two year old mark now.  Though, it's been non-operational for the last month.  A while back my DVD burner died, but it wasn't the end of the world.  I was backing up a lot of files to it at the time and my have over-worked it.  It was, after all, the generic burner Dell gives out.  At some point, I ended up subscribing to Netflix and along with that started to make copies of all the decent movies I rented.  This was fine at first, I have 1.3TB of space on that machine.  Though it may seem like a lot of space, once you account for the porn and all those DVD ISO's, it goes away quick.  So, with some money I got for my birthday, I decided to by a new burner.\nNow, I hate to turn off or reboot my computer.  So, the burner sat in a box for a week or so.  Within that time, I came home from work one night to find my computer off.  And it wouldn't turn on.  Being the tech I am, I did the normal troubleshooting such as stripping the box down to just the motherboard, RAM and video card.  Still nothing. I decided to take the CMOS battery out as resetting the BIOS was the last idea I had.  After I did that, all of a sudden the box started to power on.  I was happy for about a half second.  Then a flame came from the bottom side of the video card.  This scared the shit out of me as I have never seen a literal fire inside a computer.  After my reflexes powered the box off, the flame went out on it's own.  I was able to get the box up and running with a crappy 32MB PCI card.  This lead to me purchasing a new video card.  Which of course, is kinda nice as it's better than what I had before.  Being a mostly non-gamer though, it's not something I would like to invest money in.  I could have bought another hard drive :)\nOnce my video card arrived in the mail, I had to test it out.  I feared one thing in the back of my mind.  I was worried there may have been damage to the PCI Express slot.  And what do you know, the new card didn't work either.  So, I realized at this point that I was now going to have to buy a new motherboard.  This is not as easy as it sounds.  My desktop came with an 'awesome' BTX motherboard.  A failed attempt by Intel to redesign motherboards.  Of course, they canceled BTX boards.  Neither Newegg nor Tigerdirect even have a single one on their site.  I checked out eBay.  There were two different boards total.  One was shitty, one was fairly better than what I have now. So..., now I am left with the decision.  Go with the one single selection of BTX board I can find, or replace the entire case and board.\nCouple more weeks go by.  At this point, I have just been using my laptop and remote desktop to access my desktop.  This worked well.  That was, until I got an error from Window's saying it couldn't write a file to the disk.   Long story short, my newish 750GB drive is dead.  This was my baby.  And now, my computer is basically in shambles.\nThankfully, I should be getting some decent money back from my taxes.  I owe my mom some money, so she is getting the first dibs on it, but after that, I need to fix this heap of parts.  I am also thinking that replacing the power supply may not be a bad idea.  With the fire, and the dead hard drive, I think these issues may stem from the power supply failing.  Also, it's not a very strong one anyways, it's only rated at 350W and it's running the power hungry Pentium D along 4 hard drives.\nAnyhow, I've since been getting a lot of use out of my laptop, but I certainly don't want to kill this thing.  I don't really like having it running non-stop.",

The problems seem to have returned this past week.  Today is the first day that I feel more in control. It's hard to really explain what is going on, but I just get this overwhelming sense that I am worthless and alone.  Then I start to become really paranoid.  The worst part is, I am completely aware that the paranoia is unjustified and I try talking myself out of it, but it doesn't really seem to help.  Nothing seems to help really.  I tried sleeping it away, drinking it away.  No help.  Anyhow, this isn't meant to be a pity post or anything. I avoiding posting anything while I was being most affected as I didn't want to sound like an asshole or anything.  I really just wanted to get my thoughts out in writing to try and help deal with them.",

Based on past history, this is quite amazing.  I often will try things and they will fall apart within a weeks time.  At this point, I've been working out every other day since Jan 17th missing only a few days here and there for important events.  Last week I had worked up to a full hour of weight lifting and tonight I got this up to an hour and fifteen minutes.  I really didn't expect to notice anything for at least a couple of months, but I can already tell that I am in the best shape I have been since high school.  Yea, I still have quite a bit of fat around the belly, but underneath there is some decent muscle at this point.  I'm expecting much of this fat to slowly turn into muscle within the coming months.  I hope to have some good follow up reports on this.  Right now though, I am going to bed cause I am pretty destroyed at this point.",

This competition involved creating a five minute short movie over a 48 hour period. There was a long long night of writing Friday night, filming all day Saturday and editing that started Saturday night and went through early Sunday. It was completed ahead of schedule today.  I'd have to say I'm fairly impressed by how it turned out.  I didn't end up being as involved with this project as I have in some prior film stuff I had done, but I did get to play as an extra in one scene.\nFinally, I made some further decisions on how I am going to proceed with the future of this website.  I was planning to do a full rewrite and had Jan 1, 2009 set as my goal release date for that.  After thinking it over, I think I am going to put that on the backburner and further work on the current code.  This includes adding more features that I have been wanting, plus rewriting things in their current place.  This actually worked really well with my comment system rewrite.  Also, about the comments, currently you need to login to my site to post them; this will not be the case in the very near future.  I've always wanted the comments to be completely open to anyone, but this of course opens the door to spam.  I was using Movable Types built in comment support for the longest time, but now I am running off  of my own code.  I didn't have everything in place to prevent spammers from posting so I had removed the option for open posting, but I now thought of a simple idea that I will setup soon.",

			"About five years ago, I had a slight tear in my rotator cuff.  This should have told me long ago that I was really out of shape.  I didn't realize what had happened at the time, I thought I just pulled a muscle.  The pain never really went away though, so, after about a month I decided to see a doctor.  If you know me well, you will know I can't stand to see doctors, so this was a big step.  The doctor then told me that I had simply pulled a muscle and prescribed some pain medication.  The pain wasn't really the main issue, I was just concerned that I wasn't getting better.  This visit basically helped to once again solidify my feelings that most doctors are quite incompetent. Months went by and the pain did tone down a bit, but I never fully felt better.  ",

The pain wasn't really the main issue, I was just concerned that I wasn't getting better.  This visit basically helped to once again solidify my feelings that most doctors are quite incompetent. Months went by and the pain did tone down a bit, but I never fully felt better.  After about a year or so, I finally went and saw another doctor.  This time, it was determined that it was likely a rotator cuff tear and an MRI was scheduled.  The MRI confirmed this.  I then started to do physical therapy which did help the day of the visit.  I did this for a little while and then was left with doing some exercises on my own.  I was very inconsistent with that.  The one thing that always did help though was Celebrex.  That medication did wonders for the constant annoyance of my arm.  It was never a lot of pain, but just an endless annoyance that never went away.  Over time, I basically got used to the irritation of my arm being sore, but the cold of the winter alway made it worse.  Last winter I used up most of the Celebrex I had.  I eventually ran out and this meant that I was going to need to see another doctor if I wanted more.  I didn't have medical insurance for the longest time, so that plan was pretty much ruled out anyway.  I do have it now though.  The great thing is, now that I have been regularly exercising and lifting weights, my arm actually hasn't been giving me any trouble.  It's quite great actually.  Not only am I in the best shape I have been in the last 10 years, but the little aches and pains I've just accepted as normal are now gone.  It's really nice now when people ask how I'm doing, and I can honestly say that I'm doing great.",

			"I've begun to realize that my mind is really mostly in control of itself and just kind of does it's own thing.  I am now to the point where I have mostly gotten away from depression (I am worlds better than I was a year ago), but it still pops up from time to time.  And the odd thing is, it's often when I should otherwise be in a really good mood.  Today was somewhat not a good example of this.  I was really depressed pretty much all day long, and there was certainly a trigger that caused it to happen.  Basically, I was left a message on my phone that was very misleading and it panicked me. I later found out what the message was really about and I should have been able to move on with my day no worries, but I wasn't able to.  All day long my mind was wondering and I really couldn't focus on anything.  I really don't think I got much done, and I feel bad for my co-workers if that is the case.  What bothers me the most though is that I could not snap myself out of this.  No matter what I told myself to try and make things better, it just didn't matter.  Consciously, I knew I was fine, but subconsciously, I was a mess.",

If anything, I think that has mostly helped me overcome my mental issues I have experienced.  People who read this would probably noticed that I never wrote about these types of issues a while back, but that was because I kept it between myself and a couple of really close people that I trusted.  Actually, only two people knew about any of this until recently, even most of my close friends did not.  Anyhow, I now am to the point where I feel that either you can know this about me and be understanding, or I really don't care much about you. So, if anyone was wondering why I may have not seemed like myself today, this is why.  I don't want any pity or sorrow from anybody, so please don't think that's why I am writing this.  I just think that writing about it is another way I can try and get past these issues.  I hope one day I can look back at this post and be glad it's over.",

All week, my back had been killing me, and it was getting worse and worse.  I wasn't sleeping well as I was waking up every 30-40 minutes in pain.  I wasn't able to work very well as I couldn't sit or stand still for long periods of time and was just generally exhausted.  It also sucked as I hadn't been on the computer much lately as I didn't even feel comfortable sitting at home in front of the computer for more than short periods of time. Thankfully, Kim is an awesome friend and realizes that I was going to put off seeing the doctor as long as possible, so she just found a doctor and scheduled me an appointment.  ",

I have now seen the doctor twice and it is amazing the difference it makes.  I seen a chiropractor back in Charlotte about 5 years ago and had similar results.  I only stopped going then because the insurance ran out.  This time around, my insurance is very strange and this is going to cost me a ton at first.  It's worth it though, as my back being out of alignment pretty much throws the rest of myself off and makes life miserable. ",

			"Kinda behind on posting, so I will be writing a couple entries today.  Last weekend, Hailey, Brett, Kim and I went up north and stayed in Mackinaw City.  The trip was pretty exciting.  This was the first time I had ever taken the kids on such a long car ride.  Amazingly, they never slept the whole way up and there were really well behaved in the car.  The first day there, we didn't do a whole lot beyond settling in the hotel and doing some swimming.  We ate dinner at the Dixie Saloon. It was very delicious though a bit on the pricey side.  \nThen on Sunday we made it over to Mackinac Island.  We spent pretty much all day over there. Took a carriage tour around the island.  It started to rain during that and it was really cold.  Midway through the tour we stopped and visited the Butterfly House.  The kids seemed to enjoy it.  I envisioned it would have way more butterflies, but it was still interesting.  The carriage tour continued through the woods and to the cemetery and some other random sights.  We got off at Fort Mackinac and walked around there for a bit.  Got to see a live firing of a canon.  After that we walked around the island, browsed the shops, bought fudge.  We had another great meal at the Village Inn. There was a parade going on, so we watched that.  That pretty much concluded the second day.\nThe third day we pretty much just did random stuff.  We went to Pirates Adventure water park first.  Hailey was bugging to go to this the whole time we were there.  It was pretty much like a McDonald's playland, but with water.  At first the kids were okay there, but then this huge bucket of water dumped over the whole thing, and Hailey freaked out.  She then refused to play there anymore.  So, we had some lunch at Big Boy and then we went and played mini-putt putt at this course in Mackinaw City.  After that, we headed across the Mackinac Bridge.  We went to the Mystery Spot, which the kids really seemed to like.  Next to that was the Weird Michigan Wax Museum.  This was the stupidest thing of the whole trip.  I was picture realistic wax figures like you see of movie stars.  Instead, it was people that looked like they were made out of clay.  And, it was just depicting events I had never heard of.  We were there for about five minutes and saw all the exhibits.  I wish I could get my $14 and my five minutes back.  We then went to a scenic lookout for a bit to have a nice look at the bridge, and then we went back to the motel for pizza and rest.\nOn the last day, we got up early and checked out of the hotel.  We then made one final trip over the bridge so we could buy some pasties.  We also stopped by Castle Rock and climbed up that.  The kids barely made it up there.  We then departed for home.  I was really happy to get away from work and just the generally day to day schedule that I have to live by.  It was exciting to be able to just do whatever and whenever.  Since most of the trip wasn't really planned out, there was lots of time for just being spontaneous.  I hope I can get some money together and do something like this again in the near future.\nAlso, I have pictures of the vacation.  They are currently up on Facebook.\n\n<a href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=41310&l=7c146&id=503316760'>Day 2 on the Island</a>\n\n<a href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=41312&l=ee323&id=503316760'>Day's 3 and 4</a>",

I've been posting a lot of images into entries lately, so I thought it would be nice to have them show on the mobile site.  Initially, I automatically stripped them out as they would be too large for the mobile version.  Now that I have switched the site to using a completely database driving image system, it took about ten minutes to make it so the site will now automatically generate small images that fit properly on a mobile device.  I imagine that most of my upcoming work on the site will be to the mobile version.  Now that I have a smartphone, I using mobile sites a lot more.  I already have most of the important functionality working on the mobile site.  You can login, post comments, search.  I need to get pagination working again for the archive pages and the search.  Also, before the url for the mobile site was <a href='http://mobile.cbulock.com'>http://mobile.cbulock.com</a>, but now you can also get there by using <a href='http://m.cbulock.com'>http://m.cbulock.com</a>.",

Worse than when I'm having an anxiety attack.  Fortunately, that woozy feeling only last a couple minutes, not the hours it would last during an attack.  I do still sometimes have a mild anxious feeling that will last a long time, but it is quite manageable, unlike how it was before.  So, the medicine isn't completely getting rid of it, it's just taking the edge off quite a bit.  Another thing I've noticed this last week, my appetite is way different.  I still get hungry like normal, but I can only eat about a quarter the food I usually eat, and I'm full.  This is actually amazing, and I'm guessing it must be related to the medicine.  I've known for the longest time that I eat way more than my body needs, but I am so hungry all the time, I just can't stop.  Hopefully I will lose some weight as well.",

I guess I also feel like I am a typically giving person, and right now when I feel like I need someone, the only people that I can talk to are people I barely know.  Maybe I am really just very ignorant and the people that I think are my close friends, don't really feel the same in return.  I suppose I've never really considered that the people I care about don't really care much about me.  I always assume the best in people, and that's probably my biggest downfall.  None of this probably makes sense to anyone, and that's okay.  I do want to thank Rachael and Cristi and Sarah.  You guys have provided me with amazing support and make me feel like there is someone out there you cares.  I don't really know any of you guys that well, but I would like to change that in the future.",

My stomach was in so much pain, I think my mind was basically wiped much of it all out of my mind.  I am so out of it now as I don't seem to have a good concept of the time that has passed.  It didn't help that I missed over two days of work last week.  I woke up nauseated still this morning.  This all started on Thursday.  I started taking a new medication, Lexapro.  I think it somehow damaged my stomach.  I'm pretty sure all the pain was caused by bleeding as I was shitting this thick black tar-like stuff for the first couple days.  Lets just say that I only took it once and that was enough.  And the experience has once again fueled my dislike of doctors.  I called to get something for the nausea, 24 hours later I ended up just requesting to get switched back to my old medication.  It took five or six calls to the doctor to get this taken care of.  They didn't seem to worried that I was in massive pain.  I don't know what I'm going to do, I can't keep depending on these doctors.  So, I am back on the buspar, but still on the 10mg that I was on before, so the effectiveness is kind of lacking.  It's better than nothing though.  Of course, this all happened during a fairly busy week.  I was going to finally meet my friend Sarah for the first time in person Thursday night.  We were going to see the movie that the production group I am in, Best Little Ever, created for the <a href='http://48hfp.com'>48 Hour Film Project</a> last weekend.  It was showing in Royal Oak along with the other 25 (I think) teams.  I didn't make that as I instead left work early and somehow made it home.  Then Friday night was Rachael's party at her new apartment.  I still ended up going to that even though I wasn't feeling that well.  I started to feel somewhat better, but that went downhill as the night went on.  This is probably the first time I've ever gone to a party and not drank.  That was a bit unusual.  None the less, I got to spend time with Rachael, so I enjoyed myself as best as I could.  While I'm on that topic, meeting Rachael is one of best things that has happened to me in a while.  Through all the depression and my mind going through the turbulence of emotion, she always makes me cheerful and happy.  We seem to be on the same wavelength, and anyone that knows me knows that I don't easily find people that are like that.  So, thankfully I got to spend a lot of time with her over the last week, and that I do remember clearly.  Right now I am listening to Through Glass by Stone Sour.  I have listened to this a lot lately.  It's much how I feel about myself.  This post has once again gone in very random directions like I often do.  I think I have said all I have to say for now.  I was going to make a post a few nights ago, but I broke the login system, so I couldn't login to make the post.  Doh.  At least that's working again.",

			"I want to start this post off with a note about previous postings that I have made.  It should probably be mentioned that I certainly have been out of it here and there over the past year or two.  I'm generally in a normal state of mind, but that always isn't the case.  When I not all there, I have found that it's helpful to write about what's going on in my mind in an attempt to help myself later on.  So far, this has been working well.  The side effect of this is that the postings here generally lean toward the unusual and people have been worried.  Please, do not be concerned at this time.  I will probably let you know if worrying is needed.\nActually, right now, things are going really well.  It's kinda odd, but in about a span of two months time, I've kinda hit a bottom of how things were going and now have reached a level of things going well that hasn't been achieved in a long time.  About two months ago I was at the point of my worst panic attack ever and ended up in the urgent care.  Then, not long after that, I lost my friendship with my best friend.  Since then though, good things seem to be happening.  I've been taking medication that has been helping in unbelievable ways.  I have only had one panic attack since I started taking it, and I think I may have forgotten to take my afternoon pill that day.  I've been very careful to not forget since then.  As long as I take the medicine, I have no anxiety or anything.  I still have some anxiety late at night and when I wake up as the drugs wear off, but it's much better than the all day stuff from before.  I now feel like I can generally function normally all the time.  I've noticed that I have been much more productive at work lately.  Also, I haven't been drinking near as much as I used to.  I think much of the drinking I was doing was to suppress how bad I was feeling before.  I don't have that problem now.  In fact, I've only drank two nights in the last three weeks.  Though, I will certainly make up for lost time this Saturday as Liquid Web is having a riverboat party and much drinking will be done.  Additionally, I am now in a very happy relationship with Rachael.  I think any women I've dated since I've been married have always felt like it was forced and I was only doing it to be in a relationship and not because I liked that person in particular.  Things with Rachael seem very different, and most likely because it wasn't anything that I was really going after at first, it just happened.\nWhat else has been happening... Best Little Ever made short films, two weekends back-to-back, for the East Lansing Film Festival 48/5 contest and for the 48 Hour Film Project which is an international contest.  For the first one, I got to play my first acting role in a Best Little Ever production.  I played a bank robber.  It was a lot of fun even though I had maybe 5 total hours of sleep the two night prior to the acting day.  It was tons of fun though, and the movie ended up getting 2nd place.  Sadly, this is the third Best Little Ever film and the first one to not get a 1st place win.  The second movie I didn't work on much. I did some minor grip work the first day, but I started to feel really ill, so I ended up going home.  I would have stuck it out, but there was a ton of people there, so I was pretty sure me being gone wasn't going to affect anything.  That movie won 3rd place overall out of all the teams in Detroit and won Best Acting and Best Costumes.  That was the first international contest we entered.  There are many more movies in the works, I would like to get more into the acting as I had a good time doing that.  I am also working on the website, which is easily accessed at <a href='http://www.bestlilever.com'>http://www.bestlilever.com</a>.\nThere is more thoughts to come.  I've been slowly writing this for hours now...",

So, I plan to stay away from that stuff for now.\nThe problem is, my stomach still seems to be damaged.  I had been staying away from drinking alcohol after that last incident.  I did go out a week ago though and drank quite a bit.  I once again experienced massive pain in my stomach that lasted nearly a day.  At this point, I have decided that I am going to mostly stay away from alcohol for a while.  I'm thinking at least the next six months or so to give myself some time to recover.  I may have one beer here and there, but I don't plan to go on drinking binges like I usually do.  This should also save me some money and help me lose weight as a side effect.",

I haven't voted yet since I've lived at my apartment and I bet for a lot of people, this may be their first time voting.  So, I had no idea where I needed to go on election day.  Thankfully, the State of Michigan has a <a href='https://services2.sos.state.mi.us/mivote/'>Web Voter Information Center</a> where you can make sure that you are in fact registered and it will show you where to go.

You can also see exactly what the ballot will look like ahead of time so there are no surprises when you show up on election day.\nAlso, I want to skip any talk about the presidential election in this post. Though it's going to make a big difference on who is chosen, I think there has been enough talk about that on the news already.  I do want to get into the statewide ballot proposals though.  There are two proposals this year and both deal with health issues.  The <a href='http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ED-20_11-08_Props_Poster2_251561_7.pdf'>complete proposals</a> are a good idea to read, but I will go over some key points.  \nProposal 1 is trying to legalize medical marijuana.  Essentially, this is a humanitarian law that will give people that are suffering from illnesses another choice of a way to relieve their pain. I would find it hard to justify a good reason to deny people in pain a way to assist themselves.  But, beyond that, I also believe this is a good stepping stone around the country to fully legalizing the use of marijuana. Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Washington all already have similar laws and I think eventually people will realize that this drug is way less harmless than other legally available drugs.  I would imagine that there are already close to the same number of people that smoke marijuana that drink alcohol.  When is the last time you heard of someone getting into an accident after \"smoking and driving\", or abusing their spouse or kids after smoking.  There is so many reasons why full legalization makes sense, I don't want to get into all of it.  At the same time, this proposal is in no way a full legalization and has a lot of controls to make sure only certain people have access to it.  Even if you don't think full legalization is the way to go, at least think about the people that would benefit from this and think how you can help them.\nProposal 2 is expanding legalization of stem cell research.  I don't really know the history of this proposal, and I initially thought that it was going to be like proposal 1 where it was trying to super-cede federal law, but after reading it, it simply makes Michigan law closer to federal law, but will additional restrictions.  This seems like a win for everyone, as the federal laws are already pretty strict.  I am really curious about the signs that say \"2 goes 2 far\".  I don't really know how it goes far at all.  So, in addition to being restricted to current federal law, the Michigan law will also now allow stem cells to be taken from embryos more than 14 days old, and can only be taken from embryos that were already being created anyway and were going to be destroyed.  I don't want to get into an argument here about \"when life begins\", but, in all these cases, the embryos are already being created under current practices and then being destroyed.  So, if you feel it begins the second the sperm joins the egg, the current system is already destroying that life.  It might at least make sense to save another life before destroying that one.\n\nAnyhow, that is all I have for now.  I'm sure it's obvious that I will be voting for both of these proposals.  Please feel free to leave comments to further the discussion.\n",

This time, my stomach issue was identified as gastritis.  After the doctor explained to me what it is, and reading online about it, he is completely correct with the diagnosis.  Also, I not have a prescription for a proton-pump inhibitor to reduce my stomach acid.  I was taking Zantac before, but this stuff is much better.  I was also given a prescription for an anti-nausea medication, prochlorper.  That stuff works really well also.  I have been feeling really good since taking these medications.  I will say, there does seem to be some side effects though.  For one, I'm hungry, but I can't eat very much before feeling full.  I'm guessing that's due to the acid reduction.  This may be a good thing as maybe I'll lose some weight as well.  But, it also means I feel hungry again not too long after eating.  The other issue I notice is that I seem to have much less sensation in my body.  I don't really seem to feel things as well as I used to.  I suppose that has it's positives and it's negatives, but, I don't like not feeling things for the most part.  The doctor said I should notice feeling much better within the first three days and be completely recovered within two weeks, so I am excited about that.  This has been going on for months and months, I can't wait for it to be over.  I think I will have a new appreciation for what it's like to be a normal healthy person.\nIn other news, I got to spend a great weekend with Rachael.  Today is actually our three month anniversary, so that is some exciting news.  She also got to meet my mom, sister and stepdad on Friday night as we had a family movie outing.  Then on Saturday we went and had an interesting night with Patrick and Lona at a bowling alley out in Ovid.  It was a 9-pin bowling tournament.  I was just planning on having a fun night out bowling, but seems all these people that were there took everything way too seriously.  It wasn't even a team event.  It was mentioned this was a monthly thing and I was invited back out, but I will probably just stick around and stay home.  If I want to bowl, I can just go to Holiday Lanes which is much closer and cheaper.",

That's causing a lot of internal issues as I am hungry all the time, yet afraid to eat anything. I have seen the doctor again and he didn't really know what was going on now.  So, I am finally seeing a gastrointestinal specialist, but unfortunately that isn't for another month. I don't really know how I am going to cope until that time. Thankfully I have insurance, but the deductibles for all the medications I'm taking and the doctors visits are starting to add up.  Money is pretty much the last thing on my mind lately though.  The worst part is that I have no motivation or ambition to do anything anymore. I have basically just been trying to get through every day at work and then I just want to go home and do nothing.   For the most part, I have no social life anymore.  And, to any of my friends reading this, sorry that I haven't been up for going out and doing stuff.  If and when this is over, I will be back.\nAnother issue has been my diet.  I am not able to eat salty, fatty, or fried food.  Also can't have meat, caffeine or alcohol.  Now, I stopped drinking alcohol about two months again, and have been sticking with that.  The caffeine thing is pretty much impossible though.  I have got it so I am only drinking one caffeinated drink every two or three days.  Withdrawal headaches are really getting to me though, so I have may trying to maintain a reasonable level of caffeine to control that.  I have been avoiding meats for the most part as well, but still eating a little every other day.  Though it's not stated by the doctor, I can't eat dairy products anymore.  This is just because I have been getting extremely ill anytime I eat any dairy product.  I don't know if I have developed some type of lactose issue, I've tried taking Lactaid and it didn't help at all.  Maybe I have some type of milk allergy now.\nEssentially, this means that every single thing that I used to eat on a daily basis is now off limits.  It's hard to adjust to that.  I am hoping I will begin losing weight soon as I haven't been eating much and just drinking water for the most part.  No weight loss has seemed to happen though.  Another issue is that I haven't been working out anymore as I never feel well enough.\nIn other news, I had a birthday recently.  That was alright, got to spend the whole day with Rachael.  Sadly, I was pretty sick much of it.  Ended up missing the Liquid Web holiday party as that was the day after I was in the hospital and I had to make up work hours during the party.  That was okay though as it was an open bar and I was able to avoid the temptation to drink.  Rachael's car ended up dying the night I was in the hospital as well.  This sucks quite a bit as she is not currently working so I'm not sure how it's going to get fixed.  And she now has three weeks off of school and she doesn't have a means to get to Lansing.\nI think I will end this post for now as I don't really know where it's going and seems pretty random again.",

She gets on the bus at her mom's place in Grand Ledge.  What I left a bit early realizing the roads may not be great.  What I wasn't expecting was for there to be traffic completely stopped on the highway.  I was in some traffic jam on I-96W for at least a good 20 minutes.  I'm not certain what exactly caused it, but there were cars off the road all over the place.  I ended up having to drive Hailey to school as we missed the bus.  In all, the 40 mile round trip ended up taking me an hour and a half to complete.  Along with this, I saw at least 15 cars off the road.  I hope however decided that <a href='http://www.wilx.com/news/headlines/35007469.html'>cutting funding for salting the highways</a> is aware of the problems they are causing.\nLater tonight the kids and I are going to the movies, hopefully this day will turn around and get better.\n",

It seems that serotonin has a lot to do with how you brain processes nausea.  This stuck out to me as I have been taking a medication buspar to change serotonin levels in my brain to help with my anxiety.  On top of that, this nausea issue did start around two months or so after I started taking buspar.  I looked up more information and it looks like there are other reporting very similar issues after taking buspar.  I believe at this point, I am going to be contacting my doctor and looking into switching my medication.  The only problem is, I think any other medication for anxiety is going to be even stronger and possibly have more effects.  I will have to discuss this with the doctor though.  I may have to look for other treatments for the anxiety as well, because I think I would rather face the anxiety and panic attacks, than deal with the nausea.",

			"I typically right a review at the end of each year, this year I've been putting if off.  I planned to write this the last week of December, but I was afraid it may be depressing, so I didn't. 2008 was quite the year.  In some ways it could be described as my best year, in many ways as my worst.  It also seemed to be very easily separated into two distinct parts that seem to be demarcated right in the center of the year.  The first half of the year was mainly the partying half, while the second half was the sick half.  It's quite possible the first half caused the second half, but so far the doctors have not linked the two.\nThe first six months of 2008 were mostly filled with me drinking away almost every night possible.  I don't really recall much of this time.  The very beginning of the year I did start out slow in this aspect as I was pulled over by a cop in East Lansing in December of '07 after leaving the bar.  Only God knows how I wasn't over the limit, but it ended up being the first time ever being pulled over and not issued some ticket.  And I have been pulled over countless times.  That incident slowed down my drinking for a while, but I know I was back in full swing by St. Patrick's Day.  I had to work that day, so after work, I did the full sprint when it came to drinking.  After that, it was drink after drink, party after party.  At the time it seemed great, and I felt invulnerable.  I hadn't, and still haven't, vomited since summer of '07, so I felt like I could drink as much as I'd like with nothing to stop me.  And that's pretty much what I did.  There was a few times I was likely somewhat alcohol poisoned and that did make me reconsider what I was doing.  By the end of June or so, I think I had slowed down on the hardcore drinking somewhat.  All this time, I was starting to struggle with anxiety attacks.  These actually started around the end of 2006 or so.  They went away for a while, but started to become more and more recurrent around May.  I had a major anxiety attack near the beginning of June and went a saw a doctor.  I started taking medication for the anxiety and this helped a lot.  But, one day, I switched to a different medication and that day is when 2008 took a major change in course.\nNow, before this reverse in course took place, another event was also happening that defines the difference between the different halves of the year. Also, many of the events that took place are linked. Later in the day of my major anxiety attack that ended me up in the doctors, I met Rachael.  We started to develop a close friendship.  Two days before a party she was having and I was going to go to and spend the most time I have with her up until that point was the day I switched that medication.  It caused the most extreme pain and nausea I have ever experienced.  My stomach was bleeding and I really don't know what happened.  It seems extreme that the medication might have caused that.  I'm not sure, and my doctor said he never heard of such a thing happening.  After this, I started developing progressive problems with my stomach and digestive system.  Endless nausea started to become a regular part of my life.  Drinking alcohol and my other love, Monster, came to a halt.  With the exception of about a quarter glass of beer I had about a week ago, I've been sober a good three months now.  But, since July, I've had maybe a total of 10 beers.  This is fairly significant since there were nights I'd drink that much.  Thankfully, at this same time, Rachael and I have developed a great relationship that has helped to counterbalance the illness I have been experiencing.\nOverall, it's hard to really judge the year of 2008.  The first half was fun, but thinking back it seems like a lot of money was spent on experiences I barely recall.  It may have been exciting when it took place, it wasn't healthy or safe.  The second half was fully of great illness and great joy.  It has been really rough because I have been extremely happy with Rachael and she is the greatest thing to ever happen to me, but I've also been struggling with the worst sickness I've ever had.  It's been the best of times and the worst of times.  I know that's a quote and I'd cite it, but I don't really recall who said it.  But, it certainly describes the second half of my year.",

Though, overall, it hasn't been too bad, I was annoyed by what I did deal with.\nI installed a new CPU in my computer yesterday finally.  Last year I purchased tons of new parts for my computer, but I kept the same CPU I had previously.  I now have replaced my older Pentium D dual core with a Q9400 quad core chip.  This is a massive improvement and am very happy with it.  However, I have came up with two DRM issues that I believe are related to the change in hardware on my machine.

			"I am not someone who is exactly against DRM, for the most part I don't mind it.  I buy stuff from the Apple Store all the time and haven't been too affected by the DRM.\nI did encounter some issues with it today however.  Though, overall, it hasn't been too bad, I was annoyed by what I did deal with.\nI installed a new CPU in my computer yesterday finally.  Last year I purchased tons of new parts for my computer, but I kept the same CPU I had previously.  I now have replaced my older Pentium D dual core with a Q9400 quad core chip.  This is a massive improvement and am very happy with it.  However, I have came up with two DRM issues that I believe are related to the change in hardware on my machine.  It seems to be likely that the DRM is using the serial number in the CPU as at least one identifier.\nThe first thing I noticed was when I went to sync my iPod Touch.  I had added an app to it earlier in the day when I was at work.  When it went to sync, it told me it couldn't transfer the app to my computer as the computer wasn't authorized for it.  It asked me for my login information to authorize the machine, and after I entered it, it said I was already authorized.  Of course, the error still continued when I tried to re-sync.  This problem was easily fixed though.  I just had to deauthorize my computer, and then authorize it again, and then everything was working fine.\nThe next issue came later in the night and that I haven't really fixed.  I went to watch a show using Netflix Watch Instantly and the moment I hit 'Play', it would go to the page when the video would normally start playing and Internet Explorer would simply crash.  I use this almost daily and the problem didn't start until yesterday.  That uses DRM as well, so I can only imagine that the CPU change has messed up the DRM for Netflix.  I tried reinstalling the Netflix application, but it didn't fix anything. I will get more into this in a separate blog post, but I have now learned there is a new player that uses Microsoft Silverlight and that is working fine.\nDRM is slowly going away, but I imagine it will always be around in some fashion.  I would hope that any DRM scheme would at least have some consideration that any hardware in a computer could change and there should at least be some way to reset the DRM easily after that change.  iTunes did it well, though the errors it gave could have been more helpful.",

			"As I mentioned in my <a href='http://www.cbulock.com/2009/02/drm_woes.html'>previous post</a>, I had some issue with the Netflix player. I often use the 'Watch Instantly' on-demand service Netflix provides. I usually watch it for documentaries. Most often I watch them as I lay in bed at night as it makes it nice and easy to fall asleep. After I installed a new CPU last week or so, whenever I would go to play a movie, Internet Explorer would instantly crash. I had reinstalled the Netflix Movie Player software, but that didn't fix anything. I thought I might try calling Netflix to see if they had any suggestions as they do have a free tech support number. I wasn't expecting much, but I figured it would be worth the test it out. The first call was somewhat informative. The guy asked if I ever used Firefox, and I told him that I did all the time. I explained that I only use Internet Explorer for Netflix. He then made up some crap about how many people that don't use Internet Explorer regularly don't know when it gets corrupted or something, so when they try to use it for Netflix, it doesn't work. He then explained that there was a player for Firefox now and I could use that. I was happy to hear this, so I got off the phone and then opened up the Netflix site in Firefox. It then said the same thing it always says, that my browser wasn't compatible. I thought that maybe this feature was new, so there may have been some trick to get it to work. I did a Google search and could only find articles about people wanting the feature, or people using the IETabs Firefox extension to use Netflix in Firefox. I used to use that extension, but that wasn't going to solve anything as it still used IE, it just runs an instance of it inside of Firefox. I decided to call back and to see if the tech on the phone was just bullshitting me, or if there was some trick to get the feature to work. I talked with another guy and asked if there was a way to use Firefox, and he said there was and said he needed the email address on my account. This was somewhat annoying as the Netflix site gives you a code to dial into the automated system after you call in. I assumed this linked the call to your account, but apparently not. After I gave him my address, he directed me to go to the site <a href='http://www.netflix.com/silver'>http://www.netflix.com/silver</a>.  At that page I was able to download the Silverlight Netflix Movie Player.\nAfter installing this, I was happy to have my Netflix back. However, things weren't so great.  The new player is no where near as good as the one that I had before.  Not only that, the new one is the only one that is working now.  Even Internet Explorer is using the Silverlight player now.  \nBasically, the Silverlight player has all the problems that I have with watching Hulu.  I don't mind the Hulu issues as much though as it's free.  Since I'm paying for Netflix, I appreciated that the service was of higher quality. My setup at home is a dual monitor setup.  I have my 17\" Dell monitor and a 720P LCD TV.  I will generally watch things on Hulu when I first get home and then I will watch the Netflix stuff later at night when I am laying in bed.  The reason for this is mainly because of the screensaver timeout.  Hulu, and the new Netflix player don't turn off the Windows screensaver.  So, if I am watching something in bed, the screensaver kicks on and I have to get out of bed to correct it.  The other problem with Hulu and the new Netflix player is you can't have the player run in full-screen mode and still use the other screen.  With Hulu, this is mostly not an issue as you can use the pop-up player and maximize the browser window.  This makes Hulu like 95% in full-screen mode.  It just has the Windows window border still present.  The old Netflix player was able to do this with no problem, the new one can't at all.  So, now I have to watch movies in a little tiny window if I still want to use my computer.\nThe final issue with the new player is the video quality.  This also is about comparable to Hulu.  With the old Netflix player, the video quality was probably close to DVD quality.  I really liked that.  The new player is barely worthwhile viewing.  I mean, it's acceptable, but I'm starting to wonder why I am paying money for this.\nThe only nice thing about the new player is that it has a preview of the video as you moving the playback slider back and forth so you can see where you are in the video. But, that alone doesn't make up anything at all for the other downfalls.\nI really hope Netflix fixes these issues soon.  I fear my two main problems, the screensaver not disabling, and the lack of full-screen in the multi-monitor setup, are more issues with the fact that this is more a browser plugin than an actual software program installed on the system like the older version.  Maybe Microsoft will at least fix these issues in IE and I'd be more than willing to use that browser to watch my Netflix.",

Not even sure why it was asked if that was enough.  It should be obvious that it was way more than enough.\n\n",

			"It's once again been quite some time since I've posted.  This has been the longest gap between postings in the nearly six year history of this blog.  Today I am going to be posting about a show that I have been very into for the last year.  That show is Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.  There has been two seasons of this show now, but the first was somewhat short due to the writers strike last year.  Sadly, it was announced that the show will not be returning for a third season.\nThe first season of the show was good and set up a lot of the story for how the show would proceed.  Things like the Turk, which is the computer system that eventually becomes the brain of John Henry.  It also setup the creation of the character of Derek Reese among other things.  I felt it was a good continuation of the events of Terminator 2.  This season didn't introduce anything to mind-blowing, but offered some good solid story lines.\nThe second season was a bit interesting.  At first, they got away from doing a long story arc and instead had a lot of self-contained episodes.  This worked alright for the most part, but also made it hard to progress the story line along. Around mid-season, things went back to a story arc, but I think this is where things went bad for the show.  They got really obsessed with this \"three dots\" dream that Sarah had and also just her dreams in general.  This caused problems because there were a few episodes that were uninteresting, and also made no sense whatsoever if you had no watched the prior episodes.  I also think the inclusion of Riley (John's girlfriend) on the show was somewhat detrimental cause she never really seemed to add much to the story.\nNear the end of the second season however, things got really good again.  There was a two-part episode that was really intense, and the last two episodes had a lot of action.  The final episode was pretty interesting and explained a lot of what was going on in season two.  One thing I'm glad they explained was what exactly Catherine Weaver (the T-1001) was doing.  It actually turned out my predications were correct when she explained that she was creating a Skynet-like system to help fight Skynet.  While this was really exciting for someone who is really into the whole Terminator mythology, I can see where the show could be getting really deep and hard for new viewers to get into.  They were also making mentions of the fact that the timeline kept changing and how Jesse and Derek were from two different futures which was also going to complicate things for the casual viewer.  The last ten minutes of the last episode got really crazy though and had a pretty unexpected ending.  Cameron ended up placing her CPU into John Henry and traveled to the future.  Then Weaver and John went to the future to try and retrieve her.  None of this really made and sense as to why Cameron would have done that, or what they expected to accomplish by going after her.  They also once again made time travel seem way too easy to do.\nAfter that ending, I'm not entirely sure how another season would have even continued.  There would have had to been a really interesting story to explain all that and get the show back on a somewhat normal track.  However, it looks like that won't be happening anyway now.\nOn another Terminator note, the movie Terminator Salvation is coming out on Thursday.  I am so excited about this.  I  bought tickets about a week ago to see the midnight showing of it with Rachael.",

			"My last post was about my excitement with Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and how I loved that show and how I couldn't wait to see Terminator Salvation.  Sadly, I learned the show, which has now been cancelled, has a much better storyline. Please note that there will be SPOILERS in the review so you probably don't want to read past the second paragraph if you haven't watched it yet.\nTerminator Salvation has had a lot of good reviews, and a lot of bad reviews. This will be a bad one.  I suppose the issue is, depending on what you are expecting from Terminator, you will really enjoy the movie, or really hate it.  For an action movie with a lot of visuals, it was an amazing experience.  It did in fact look like what you can imagine the world would be like.  That's about as good as the movie got though.  I really get into the whole mythology of the Terminator world.  I realize the story is complete fantasy, but even in fantasy, there can be a lot of principals and rules that need to be followed.  Just ask any Trekkie.  I am also really into time travel which is probably what draws me to Terminator.  On that note, I just watched an AMAZING time travel movie, Timecrimes.  I really suggest watching that.  It is a rare story that actually presents time travel with a closed causality loop, something most movies seem to avoid as it's hard to get right.  Anyhow, that is another story.\nA lot of the problems I had with the movie had to do with the reality of what should have been possible if Skynet really did exist and really was trying to eliminate mankind.  I'm sure this is complicated to get right as the movie in a way is both a prequel and a sequel.  What I mean by this is it takes place about 15 years after Terminator 3, at the same time, it's about 10 years before the Terminators go back in time.  So, Skynet isn't quite as developed as it was when it created time travel, but it's had a fair amount of time to work on it's human elimination plan.  I'm sure that could possibly explain some of the failings.\nThe movie starts out alright.  The initial scene where Connor and the other resistance fighters sneak into some Skynet base is actually pretty cool.  The helicopter scene was pretty exciting.  Though, it did have some Mission Impossible feel to it as they were dropping down into the base.  After that whole helicopter incident though, I guess we see why John Connor becomes the savior of mankind.  He is apparently a super-human.  He is taken back on a helicopter and jumps from the helicopter into the ocean and swims into a submarine.  Without SCUBA gear might I add.  At that point, I was already in a WTF mind-frame.\nAfter this, we see the first of Marcus Wright.  Of course, the trailer had to ruin the fact that he is part-machine, which would have been interesting to have found out part way through the movie.  The first scene is just him in some mud screaming. The same scene in the trailer.  At that's it.  There is no explanation further than that.  It seemed to be one of a number of scenes that solely existed to make the trailer more interesting.  He then makes his way into LA where he is saved by Kyle Reese.  The initial exchange, which is also fully shown in the trailer, is very basic and too quick.  Pretty much \"What year is it?  What happened here?\"  Of course, Judgement Day at this point happened nearly 15 years before, so if some random stranger was asking me \"What happened?\", I don't think I'd just assume he was asking about Judgement Day. I'd also start asking a number of questions as to \"Why don't you know what year it is?\" and \"How are you unaware of Skynet?\".  Instead, Kyle just happily lets him hang out and explain everything no questions asked.  Cause it's pretty common for people to just show up and not know what's happened for the last 15 years. Then, for whatever reason, Marcus decides to randomly fix a radio, just a the right time to hear a speech from Connor that explains how to kill the T-600's.  And to also hear Connor's name, which conveniently sets up the later scene where they meet him. The whole radio thing just seems a bit too set up.\nThe next part that is troubling is the fact that Kyle Reese is even named as the number one target by Skynet.  Maybe I've been watching the TV series too much, but it seems that John would have to keep the whole thing about Kyle being his father a complete secret.  So, why would Skynet be interested in him?  Makes no sense.  Basically, if Skynet knew future events and that John was going to help humanity take down Skynet and that Kyle was going to go back in time and be his father, wouldn't it be easier to just not build the time machine?  I guess this opens up a lot of the problems of the time travel story anyhow, but it just doesn't seem like Skynet should have known about him.\nThough, now that I think about it, the next part of the movie that was really annoying was the scene where Marcus was captured.  John goes into his rant about \"you killed my father, you tried to kill my mom, you tried to kill me\".  And he does give names out.  Which doesn't make sense.  Seems like he knows that Skynet found out about his mom and went back in time to kill her, so keeping her name quite may be a good idea.  And also to keep Kyle's name quite as he is still around.  Why would you tell a machine your father's name.  However, that doesn't matter because Marcus very calmly explains that Kyle was just captured by Skynet.  He doesn't question the fact that Kyle is only a young man, way too young to be John's father.  And on top of that, John takes the news without question.  I mean, this information was just given to you by someone you consider to be the enemy, yet he takes it as fact right off the bat.\nLet's see, after that, or actually, maybe before that, we learn that Skynet has fully taken control of the area around San Francisco.  However, the fact they were sending machines into LA was unusual and it was mentioned that they don't normally travel that far.  It doesn't seem like Skynet has really taken over all that much actually.  Plus, people have a full military with jets and submarines.  It makes the destruction of the world not seem quite so bad.  I suppose this made me feel like Skynet wasn't quite so scary.  They must have made some good progress between 2018 and 2029 as at that point, they have fully taken over LA and people are hiding underground.  Another odd thing to note, how come more people aren't in LA?  They even said Skynet doesn't normally go there.  Seems like a good place to hide out.\nBack to the Marcus capture scene, another thing that seemed really random was the one pilot chick he saved setting him free.  I'm sure she felt some connection to him after he saved her life.  However, she then just found out that he is a machine.  The same things they have been fighting from for years.  I can see her arguing to have him be studied and to learn more about him as he was different.  But, to just set him free?  She risked her life for a machine.  Doesn't seem like a normal reaction even considering that he saved her.\nMoving on further into the movie, the whole thing inside of the Skynet complex was just nuts.  The main thing being that Kyle was the number one target on a Skynet termination list.  So, they capture him and put him in a prison.  Now, they try to explain this away by saying he is bait to capture John Connor, but if they actually killed him, Connor would have still come.  I don't see why they didn't kill Kyle.  Even so, somehow, John Connor is inside of the Skynet complex, and Skynet is STILL unable to kill him.  They have one actual Terminator in this entire central base?  What type of operation is Skynet running.  The first base they went to had no machines, and their main base had one?\nThe scene where Skynet explains their whole plan to Marcus was just too stupid to mention. It was basically the same thing that happens at the end of every episode of Scooby Doo after they take the mask off the criminal.  I guess at that point in the movie, I was unshocked at how stupid it could get.  \nFinally, the movie ends with a heart transplant being done at some medical base that is just throw together in the middle of nowhere.  I'd like to think that by 2018 heart transplants can just be done at anytime and anywhere, I'm sure it's a lot more complicated than that.  Plus, didn't Marcus just die and have to be resuscitated moments before? I'm not sure if he was really a good candidate for a heart transplant.\nI suppose that will conclude my rant for now.  There is probably a lot more I could say.  It's been a week now since I saw the movie, so it's not fresh in my mind, and I only saw it the one time.  I'm sure I'll see it again once it's on DVD.  This movie may actually be a rental though, and might be the first Terminator I won't actually own.",

I also have a 2nd gen iPod Touch, so I'm familiar with most of the features of the iPhone as well.  Additionally, I've used Palm devices in the past, owning a Palm m130 and a Sony Clie NX-60.</p>\n\n<h4>Exterior</h4>\n\n<p>There are a couple aspects that need to be explored, first is the hardware.  I love the size of the device.  Based on the pics, I was expecting it to be a bit larger.  It's actually almost the exact same size as my HTC Touch which I feel is basically the perfect size for a phone.  One thing I miss from the Touch is the rubberized case.  Before the Touch I had a Motorola PEBL and both had rubberized cases and it gave a secure feeling grip when holding the phone.  The Pre on the other hand is the exact opposite.  It is super smooth.  It's not bad however and I'll get used to it.  The device is extremely light-weight.  Much lighter than you'd expect it to be.  The screen is completely amazing.  Super clear, really bright.  It's right on par with the iPod Touch, but with an even higher DPI.</p>\n\n<h4>Keyboard</h4>\n\n<p>The keyboard has been an area of love and hate among a lot of people.  It is in fact really small. I've only used two PDA's with keyboards, those being the NEC MobilePro 450 and the Clie NX-60.  The Clie's keyboard was pretty crappy for the most part.  The NEC had an amazingly nice keyboard, but the device is also at least three times the size of the Pre and has the keyboard oriented the long length of the device.  I don't know if having the keyboard slide from the bottom up is the best idea.  I think I'd prefer a keyboard on the side of the device like most other smartphones with keyboards.  However, after the first day, I found myself getting pretty quick at typing on the keyboard.  I'm already faster at typing on the Pre than I was on my HTC Touch which just used an on-screen keyboard.</p>\n\n<h4>USB</h4>\n\n<p>The USB connector is somewhat annoying.  I don't really like the fact that it's on the side of the device.  The battery life isn't insanely great by any means, so there does come times where the phone needs to be plugged in while on a long conversation.  Talking on the phone with the cord coming out the of the side is not that comfortable. I also would have preferred a mini-USB connector as opposed to the micro-USB connector solely due to the fact that my last couple of phones have also used that connector and so does my girlfriends T-Mobile G1.  Now all my chargers are useless.  The plus side is that the micro-USB connector is being slated to become an <a href='http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13970_7-10165603-78.html'>official standard power connector</a> for future cell-phones from a number of major manufacturers. Additionally, I'm not a fan at all of the cover over the USB connector. The first couple times I took it off, I was almost certain I was going to break it.  It probably will break off in due time as the thing holding it on doesn't seem that sturdy.  I'm guessing this was placed on the phone for aesthetic reasons, and I don't think it would have been as big a deal if the USB was on the bottom.  This is one area where Palm decided to go with style over functionality.</p>\n\n<h4>Storage</h4>\n\n<p>When it comes to storage, I am really sad that there is no microSD card slot.  With the ability to sync with iTunes, this phone could have possibly replaced my iPod Touch. However, with only 8GB of storage, I don't really see that happening.  The 8GB is probably plenty for using just apps and such, but can't unseat the iPod when it comes to being a media device.  With the Internet connectivity it has though, it may get more using as a streaming device, it already has Pandora, and hopefully we'll see more apps such as Sling Player and a Hulu app would be amazing.</p>\n\n<h4>Hardware Issues</h4>\n\n<p>There are a couple of hardware annoyances I have found.  When the slider is closed, the top screen portion can pivot quite a bit. Having never owned a slider before, I'm not sure if this is normal, but it feels like the slider mechanism could break because of this.  It feels pretty solid when opening and closing it though.  Just not after it's closed.  There is a problem that comes up after charging the device for a while.  The touchscreen loses it's calibration.  It doesn't happen right away, but about 30 minutes into charging, I can't use the touchscreen anymore.  The clicks register in the wrong locations, and swipes show as numerous random clicks all over the screen.  I don't know if this is heat-related or what, but it seems to be corrected right away once the charger is disconnected.</p>\n\n<h4>WebOS</h4>\n\n<p>Now on to more of the software end of things.  WebOS is really amazing.  It looks so good.  The text is really clear and easy to read.  All of the animations are really smooth and everything really seems to be generally user friendly.  I can't wait for more applications to come out to really show off what the OS can do.</p>\n\n<h4>Text Entry</h4>\n<p>I mentioned before, the keyboard isn't great, but you get used to it.   I'm already pretty quick at text entry.  I like that there is a dedicated @ button and a period.  The slider opens and closes really nicely, so it's super easy to shoot out a quick text.  There are a couple area's where the text input is lacking. One is the lack of a suggestive dictionary.  The Pre will do minor corrections like adding apostrophes and changed 'U' to 'you'.  It would be nice to see an on-screen selection of suggested words though as the Touch would get really good at choosing the most likely word and a simple press of a space would complete the word and be ready for the next.  I'm a really bad speller, so this would also be a life saver for when I'm guessing at spellings.  Another missing feature is a character count when sending SMS messages.  I try whenever possible to keep my messages under 160 characters as it's annoying to get multi-part messages, especially when they come out of order.  And with Twitter being the latest craze, the 140 character limit is important to not surpass.  I hope Palm adds something in a later update.</p>\n\n<h4>Camera</h4>\n<p>The camera is pretty decent, though the software is really lacking in extra features.  Two things really stand out though.  A big one being the background processing of the images.  When you take a picture, you can take another one instantly.  This is something that is usually only found in higher end digital camera.  My Fujifilm 8MP camera isn't even as quick to recover from a picture.  The flash found on the camera is also really nice.  It's fairly bright and does a good job of allowing inside shots to look decent.  The overall picture quality is probably average from what you'd expect from a 3MP camera phone. It really easy to take the pics and then email, send over MMS, or add to Facebook.  However, I had some trouble adding to Facebook when I tested.  The first pic worked fine, then further pics would give an error.  This could have been an issue on Facebook's end too though.</p>\n\n<h4>Google Maps</h4>\n\n<p>The Google map app is really basic.  It's got the standard features of map view, satellite view, GPS and directions and search.  But, that is about it.  I'm sad to see things like Street View are missing and especially Latitude.  The GPS on the Touch took forever to startup, so I didn't use Latitude much, I was hoping this phone would give a good experience with it.</p>\n\n<h4>Contacts/IM</h4>\n\n<p>Synergy is a great change in the way to handle contacts.  Being that I have most the people I communicate with on Facebook, a big portion of my contact list was automatically imported when I synced up with Facebook.  The Gmail integration is great too.  If you are using Google products, the Google syncing is nice.  I was already using them, but if you weren't before, you'd want to if you have the Pre as your contacts and calendar are constantly up to date both online and on the phone.  The syncing with Google's service is fairly quick.  I'm not sure how often it updates, but it's not too extremely long.  Facebook on the other hand, I'm less certain on the update frequency.  I added a couple contacts this morning, and as of late night, they still aren't showing on the phone. I also went into the account preferences and clicked the sync accounts option and that had no effect.  Otherwise, the Facebook integration is pretty slick.  It's nice having all the contacts images show up when interacting with IM, email and such.  Pretty much ever camera phone has the ability to show pictures with contacts, but I rarely ever actually had pictures for my contacts as it's a lot of work getting them and adding them.  Now my caller ID almost always actually shows the person calling.  It's a really nice touch, and in the future my contacts won't even need to inform me if they change phone numbers or email addresses. As long as they keep their Facebook up to date, I'm all set.</p>\n<p>The IM software seems a little rough still.  One thing I find odd is that the Synergy concept of combining contacts doesn't translate over to the IM buddy list.  Right now the IM client only supports AIM and GoogleTalk, but if you have contacts that use both, they show up separately on the list.  This is another area I hope Palm touches up a bit in an update later.  AIM contacts don't really seem to be manageable either, so you will want to make sure to clean up your contact list before importing your AIM account.  I have been using the same account for around 8 years or so, which means I have numerous contacts that I no longer communicate with and many I have no idea who they are anymore.  The minute you add AIM to the Pre, all these names will show in your contact list though.  And there is no way to remove them without removing the whole AIM account.  I ended up doing that first, and then when through and deleted a bunch of contacts, then re-added AIM. I would like to see Facebook chat added in the future.  Facebook is already integrated into the contacts, calendar, and photo app, doesn't seem to be a reason to not have chat as well. One last note, the IM app keeps kicking me offline a lot, and doesn't reconnect me.  I realize that the data service is down when on calls, so if you are not in a Wifi area, you will have no data service.  But, it seems it should reconnect when the data returns.  And it often does, but it's inconsistent.</p>\n\n<h4>Other App Stuff</h4>\n<p>The App Catalog leaves much to be desired.  Not much apps on there at all.  There is finally one game.  I was somewhat surprised to see there wasn't at least one or two basic games included on the device.  Also, the App Catalog states it is in beta.  There is no prices on anything, they all just say \"Try Me\", so it's hard to see if apps are demos or free.  The Classic emulator gives a message after you download it that it's only good for 7 days.  There is no way to purchase anything via the App Catalog yet though.  There are actually two Twitter apps though.  I haven't been all that impressed though.  I was using PockeTwit on Windows Mobile and really like that app.  I expected to see the Twitter apps on WebOS to be a little more integrated, giving notifications when I received DM's or my username was mentioned for instance.  I hope there is some improvements in the Twitter apps because I've really been lost when it comes to Twitter this last week.  What really needs to be done is the SDK needs to be released to everyone so that people can get some better apps out there. Also, I don't see anyway to delete apps once they have been installed.  I hope I'm missing something obvious, but there is no program manager like Windows Mobile has, and I can't seem to do anything except move the app icons around.  Holding the icons down doesn't do anything like it does on the iPod.</p>\n\n<h4>Final Notes</h4>\n<p>I'm not planning to review all the apps.  I think the rest of the apps work pretty much as you'd expect.  I'm curious if there was an user manual that came with the Pre.  Mine didn't have one, and this is probably the first gadget I've ever owned that didn't have a nice fat manual.  Maybe it's expected that you will download a PDF off of Palm's website.  I really feel that a lot of the apps were rushed to get the Pre out the door.  I really hope to see that vast improvements in features in coming updates.  Battery life, it's pretty bad.  If you talk on the phone a lot at least.  I've been charging my phone overnight, and then also once in the middle of the day.  I expect this to be less of an issue once the newness runs out and I'm not tinkering around as much.  Much of this review may sound pretty negative.  I don't want people to get the complete wrong impression though.  I love this device.  Easily the best phone I've owned.  All the main issues I have are all software related, so I really hope Palm spends some more time on the software and releases some amazing updates.</p>",

I did however get him the one and only gift he asked for, which was a Batman costume for his Build-a-Bear tiger.  I plan to get him some more gifts before the weekend.  I'm going to try and throw some type of party for him on Saturday.\nWork has seemed busy for the last month or two for some reason.  The economy doesn't seem to be affecting my employer too much. I've been really interested in space again for some reason.  I've been hitting <a href='http://www.hulu.com'>Hulu</a> pretty hard with various space series such as Carl Sagan's 'Cosmos', and the History series 'The Universe'. I'm also starting to catch up on the new season of Curb Your Enthusiasm.  I wish HBO would create some way to subscribe to it's programming online.  I'd be more than willing to pay to watch Curb and Bill Maher, I just don't feel like getting an entire cable TV package to do so. So for now, I am a little behind while I have to find episodes after they are released.\nIn personal news, I have gone over two weeks now without taking any type of medication.  And I'm feeling extremely healthy.  I'm almost certain at this point that my anxiety medication is somehow causing my nausea. In the two weeks that I haven't taken the anxiety pills, my stomach has been completely fine.  It's very relieving to not be controlled by those pills though.  At one point, I had trouble going more than a couple of hours without the medication and I was taking up to six pills a day.  I think I might be to the point now where I might be able to stay off of them for good.  Up until now, I could never go more than three days between medication.  I have sure been trying since around March to take longer and longer gaps between each pill. I think breaking that three day mark was the big key to getting off of this.  Anyhow, I have to get to bed.  With the kids in school, my alarm is now going off at 6:30AM.  It's not good.",

			'Here are two things I hope to live to see:\n\n1)  Elimination of daylight saving time\n\n2)  Elimination of timezones',
		entry_text:
			"Here are two things I hope to live to see:\n\n1)  Elimination of daylight saving time\n\n2)  Elimination of timezones\n\nThe daylight saving time thing has bugged me for the longest time.  It especially became an enemy of mine when we went through the whole change in when the date of the DST changeover took place.  That required a couple days of code updating I had to do at my previous job.  Living in a computerised world, having the time of day change really just causes complications in general.  For example, how many minutes are there between 3:00PM Dec 1st 2007 and 3:00PM Aug 1st 2007.  If you forget to calculate for DST, you will be off.\nDaylight saving time seems to be more suited for the agricultural based society of the past.  The only solid argument I've seen for DST is the fact that kids have to get on the bus early in the morning when it's dark.  It seems to me that a much better solution would just have school start an hour later during the winter months.  I see no reason the entire country should change time itself when schools would be very capable of simply changing the start and end times.\nThe elimination of timezones is something that is probably less likely in my lifetime, but is still something that would be nice to see.  It's something that would likely receive a lot of resistance, especially in the metric-system-fearing United States.  The idea would be to just have all time run on Greenwich Mean Time.  I can imagine this taking at least a good year for people to really get used to the switch once it took place, but I don't see it being overly too difficult.  This of course would change time the way people are used to and have grown their whole lives being accustomed to.  For instance, what time the sun goes down and such would change.  However, it's not like we don't already have a fairly arbitrary system.  It's currently based solely on the sun.  It's not like we wake up exactly at noon and go to sleep at midnight.  The times at which we do things are completely arbitrary as it is.  The average person generally wakes up around 7 or 8.  Works 9-5.  Who would really care at the end of it all if 9-5 became 1-9?  We live in a globalized world and I think we have to start thinking of time in a global sense and not just a local sense.  The creation of time zones were actually in effect the first step toward that.  Before timezones, time was relative to the city you were located in.  People in the late 19th century were able to change their way of thinking and moved to timezones to more easily make things easier on a national level.  It's probably time we move to the next step in that progress.",

I don't recall how I initially enabled the root access, but I seem to recall that it required connecting the phone to my computer and it didn't work on Windows 7.  So, that was going to require that I load up a virtual machine on my desktop and figure it out again.  Instead, I was able to install the Terminal application from Preware and was able to get a root console that way.  I don't know why Palm made this change, but I now see they also updated the hostname on the device for some reason. Before, the hostname was simply 'castle', which was the Pre's codename.  Now the hostname shows as 'palm-webos-device'.  Hopefully this is the last time Palm makes this change as I like having control over the phone.",

The trip there ended up being a bit interesting. When driving onto the I-96 entrance ramp at Pennsylvania St, around the curve I hit some ice and dig a nice fishtail that had me end up in the ditch.  I attempted to drive out, but with all the grass being covered in snow and ice, my attempts were futile.  I wasn't the first person to end up in the ditch. A little further up the entrance ramp, there was another car that was in the ditch on the other side of the road.  Thankfully, that other car had already called for police assistance as a cop car showed up within a minute of me ending up in that ditch.  The cop came over and let me know that a tow truck was on its way and I could just stay in the car to stay warm.",

I attempted to drive out, but with all the grass being covered in snow and ice, my attempts were futile.  I wasn't the first person to end up in the ditch. A little further up the entrance ramp, there was another car that was in the ditch on the other side of the road.  Thankfully, that other car had already called for police assistance as a cop car showed up within a minute of me ending up in that ditch.  The cop came over and let me know that a tow truck was on its way and I could just stay in the car to stay warm.\nThe cop car stayed and blocked off one of the lanes of the ramp in an attempt to get cars to slow down.  I wasn't sure how good of an idea that was, as that meant that not only did people have to slow down, but they also had to unexpectedly merge lanes.  Things were going well for a while, but I was getting worried as there were a lot of people fishtailing around that corner.  I started to feel like a sitting duck, only took one other person to lose control and they were hitting me.  Eventually that came really close.  A car lost control and did a 360 going toward me, ending up on the side of the road, maybe 15 feet from my car.  Was somewhat of a scary moment.  Not long after that however, the moment I was expecting to happen took place. Yet another car fishtailed and lost control.  That guy however crashed into the cop car.  It was at that point I felt much less stupid about being in the ditch.  At that point the cop moved his car and completely closed off the ramp.  The highway entrance was probably closed for a good 20 more minutes.  Eventually the tow truck came and pulled me out.\nI am generally a pretty good driver and have only been in a ditch two previous times.  Once 12 years ago when my brakes went out, and another time 8 years ago during a whiteout near Grand Rapids and a miscalculation on where the road was.  Both those times I was able to get out.  This was a somewhat embarrassing situation for me.  It didn't help that I was all dressed up, and was also in the car with Rachael and Brian.  Thankfully, in the end, my car was totally fine and no one was hurt.  I luckily slide in between two of the roadside reflectors so those didn't do any damage to my car, and the car fairly easily was able to be pulled out.  We all ended up making it to the Liquid Web party, and had an interesting story to tell.",

			"<p>Once upon a time, writing a webpage for a mobile phone meant that you had to really limit what you were doing.  Mobile phone development had three main limitations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Small screen size</li>\n<li>Limited markup capability </li>\n<li>Slow network connection</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The screens were very very small on older mobile phones.  This meant that not much could be displayed. On top of that, the markup languages that were supported could not do very much.  Long ago, only WML was supported.  Later devices would support XHTML Basic Profile.  This was pretty close to true HTML, but still only a subset.</p>\n\n<p>What's really exciting now however, is that mobile browsers have, for the most part, surpassed the general capabilities of desktop browsers. The primary reason for this is due to the fact that Internet Explorer is still dominating desktop browsers, and the fact that mobile phones have a very quick renewal cycle.\nModern mobiles such as the iPhone, Android phones and webOS devices all have browsers that are HTML5 compatible.  On the desktop, you have Firefox, Safari and Chrome that also have these capability, but they aren't in such widespread usage, so you can't design your site with the expectations that HTML5 will be available.  Once Internet Explorer 9 comes out, all the major browsers will support it.  Microsoft will probably do something wrong with their implementation like they always do, so we will probably have to wait until at least Internet Explorer 10 or 11 until the desktop catches up.</p>\n\n<p>So, to design a mobile site today, we still have the screen issue.  But this is no where near of a concern as it used to be. The Nokia 3390 had a 84x48 resolution screen and the Nokia 3560, which had a full XHMTL browser had only a 176x208 screen. Modern devices are giving at least a 480x320 screen and upwards of 854x480.  This is still much less than the desktop, but is still around the same size that was common to desktops only a decade ago. Though, the physical screen size still has a lot of limitations as much of the increase in resolution was due to increasing the pixel-per-inch count.</p>\n\n<p>But, when it comes to the markup language, we now have the ability to go full force with some of the exciting technologies found in HTML5 such as the database storage and offline features. Markup language is no longer a limiting force in mobile development, quite the opposite, in fact.  Mobile websites will actually have more advanced features than their desktop counterparts.  Very exciting!</p>\n\n<p>The last limitation, network speed, is also fast disappearing. While mobile phone networks aren't quite as fast as a cable modem, 3G networks are now covering most populated areas.  This means we can at least expect speeds that are about ten times faster than dialup internet.  With 4G starting to appear, some areas now actually do have cable internet-like speeds.</p>",

I will admit that they have made some stupid mistakes when it comes to the way they have changed some default settings.  But, what seems to be overlooked is that, every time Facebook does this, they place some huge message on the newsfeed explaining what they changed. I can only assume most people just close the message and not read it, because I've always been extremely informed about these changes directly from the Facebook website.</p>\n<p>On top of this, the Facebook control panel isn't overly complicated.  There are a fair number of options, but they also allow you to highly configure the privacy controls to a high level of detail.  You can fine tune things so that individual people can't see certain items on your wall. I can't think of any other site that gives such control.  They do offer <a href='http://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.php'>some details on how the privacy works</a> on their site. When you go into the <a href='http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy'>privacy settings</a> which can be found on the Account menu, you are given a page with six categories.  On the top three, you are given a selection of various area's of your profile and what limits you want to share your privacy.  Basically, everyone, friends of friends, friends or you can customize and make it so only certain groups of people can see the info.  That seems pretty straight forward.  If you are unsure that privacy settings are how you want, you can click \"Preview my profile\" and it will show you what your profile page looks like to the general random person viewing it.  At the top, you can also type in a persons name and see exactly how that person would see it.  If you ever have any reservations as to if your profile is locked down well enough, this is the place to go.</p>\n<p>The next option on the privacy page seems to cause the biggest conflict.  That is the applications and website settings. On that page, you can control things like how your information is shared with apps, and what your friends can share.  You can also disable the \"Instant Personalization\" feature. Oddly, there is no link here to directly edit the sites and apps settings.  That can be also found under the Account menu under \"Application settings\". Finally, the last two options on the privacy settings, search and block list, are pretty self-explanatory and basic.</p>\n<p>While the privacy panel isn't basic, if you are really concerned about privacy issues, sending 5-10 minutes to explore the options really isn't a huge cost. I don't mind this personally periodically explore the options as I sometimes decide to change things around.</p>\n<p>As for why I'm not leaving Facebook; basically those privacy issues don't bother me, so it's business as usual. Facebook actually makes things much nicer on a day to day basis for me.  My phone integrates with it really well. Anyone I ever talk to on the phone is on Facebook, so when they call, I have their most recent profile picture display on the screen.  I think that is very handy.  Whenever I take a picture or a video, I can easily upload the picture or video straight to my Facebook account with just a couple of clicks.  This allows me to share events with my family nearly instantly as they take place. On top of that, if anyone has their phone number on their Facebook profile, its already in my contacts. Facebook has become an overwhelmingly useful extension to my phone.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are the typical social network reasons for staying on board with Facebook.  No other place on the Internet has so many people I know together.  That makes it much more convenient to stay connected with people and know what's going on.  When I plan events anymore, I just set them up on Facebook and invite the appropriate people.  Since usually 90% of the people I intend to invite are already on Facebook, this works out really well.</p>\n<p>I also really enjoy the Instant Personalization feature.  I am sick of having to sign up for accounts over and over again. Facebook already had the Facebook Connect feature which allows using your Facebook account to login to other sites, but this makes it happen a bit more automatically.  On top of this, in many ways it is actually better to use this method to sign on to sites than to create new accounts everywhere. You have no idea the security and privacy settings on every site.  It's true that Facebook could leak information, but if it is just in one location, that is much better than having logins on hundreds of sites.  If at any time in the future, you want to disconnect your login from a site that you used Facebook Connect, or the Instant Personalization with, you can go into the Application Settings on Facebook and remove that site.  If you didn't use Facebook, you'd have to figure out each site individually and determine their method of removing your account info.  That seems to me to be much more secure than not using Facebook.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, that's my random thoughts on Facebook.  Feel free to comment.</p>",

She will help pick up the table after dinner, help me load the dishwasher, help me take out trash, etc.  She told me one day that I always do so much work around the house and it isn't fair if no one helps me.  I thought that was really sweet of her. I've been giving her an allowance since she was five, and she also realized that she is now earning her allowance by helping out.\nTonight I was really in for a treat.  After dinner I was looking up some stuff on the computer.  She cleaned off the table as she had been doing.  Then she started to take dishes out of the dishwasher that had been cleaned the night before. She knew where many of the dishes went, but she had to ask me on a few. I was excited that she just decided to do this on her own. I was a little distracted with what I was looking at, and then she came over and asked me if it was okay to put the soap in the dishwasher.  I told her \"Oh, no, don't do that yet. I need to fill it up with the dirty dishes first.\" She then says, \"Dad, I already did that\". I look over, and all the dishes from the counter were gone and she did indeed fill up the dishwasher.  She even put everything in there correctly.\nI've been very proud of her with the initiative she has been taking. It's great to see her wanting to do good things for the sole purpose of being a good person. Maybe I'm weird, but as a parent, while first steps and first words were neat, I think this is the stuff that truly excites me.\n\nAlso, while I'm on the topic of Hailey, she wanted to do her own blog like the one I have, so I setup a <a href='http://hailey.may.bulock.com'>website</a> for her. I thought it would be a good way for her to share her feelings and get more comfortably with writing. She decided to call it <a href='http://hailey.may.bulock.com'>\"Hailey's Thoughts\"</a>, much like the name of this blog :)",

I am a pack rat and there is tons of crap that I simply don't need to be saving.  I have been attempting to put myself into a mentality of making sure I'm only saving things that I really need to save.

			"I'm in the process of getting ready to move into a new apartment.  I've been living in my current place for almost 4 years now.  My current project is going through all the boxes in the basement and determining what I'm keeping and what I'm tossing.  I am a pack rat and there is tons of crap that I simply don't need to be saving.  I have been attempting to put myself into a mentality of making sure I'm only saving things that I really need to save. This hasn't been easy, but I have already been able to toss around five boxes worth of items. All of the boxes that are in the basement have been there since I have moved in and have never really been looked at.  Because of that, it's pretty clear that almost 100% of that stuff can go. If I haven't needed it in the last four years, it is likely that there is no reason to keep it.\nHowever, actually going through the items has been a difficult process.  To step back a little, most these boxes have been unopened since my divorce.  My ex-wife separated a little over five years ago. At that time I moved in with my dad. She ended up packing up most of my belongings and I moved them into my dads place.  I didn't really need much when I was living with my dad as he was very helpful and taking care of everything I needed while I was there. So, those boxes just lingered. I ended up moving out of his house around a year later and he was also in the process of moving so I took all my boxes with me. They basically just moved straight to the basement where they have remained. I essentially just started over with my life after that divorce and never really thought about looking at what was in those boxes.  What I now have down there in that basement is a snapshot of a life that I've mostly forgotten about.  That time of my life mostly just seems no different than watching a movie in my head, it doesn't really seem real anymore. \nBut, looking through these boxes has brought back a lot of those memories and a lot of emotions with it as well. I haven't been able to discard a number of items.  I've found a lot of things that I was happy to see.  There were pictures from when I was in high school. Pictures from my graduation. I found my wallet that contained senior pics of many of my close friends. I found my senior ring, I've found a lot of CD's that contained the music I listened to through my teen years. I also found some clothes I didn't know I had.  Some of them certainly didn't fit anymore, but I found a lot of socks that are in nearly new condition. Also found some dress shoes and ties that I can use.\nOn the other hand, there were a number of items that I really didn't need to dig up. One of those senior pics included my ex-wife's senior pic. There were saved Valentine Day's cards, and then even things such as old check books from our bank account. These random items seemed to really bring back emotions that I don't think I was really ready to revisit. It's kinda strange as I haven't really thought about the divorce or anything in years.  I did have a hard time back when it happened, but I was able to get past that and rebuild my life and I am happier today than ever before. I guess it's one of those things that maybe you never get over fully.  \nAt this point, I've got the boxes mostly dealt with. I saved a number of books, I found my original birth certificate, I'm saving that.  Other than the books, I have about two boxes of random things I feel that I should probably save.  I'm not 100% certain what I will do with these boxes, I won't have a basement anymore. Hopefully I can find some space.",

I did finally start trying out some of the beers in there, and here is my short review of Sam Adam's Chocolate Bock. \nI was really excited about this beer before I tried it.  Bock's are probably my favorite type of beer, and I drink a fair amount of Shiner Bock and Amber Bock.  Being somewhat of a heavy fellow, I can also say that I enjoy my share of chocolate, so this beer seemed like an interesting combination. \nI can't say I really enjoyed the beer however.  What I was expecting was a bock with a slight hint of chocolate taste.  Instead, this beer had a very strong cocoa taste to it. It didn't really taste like beer at all.  It was more like drinking liquid semi-sweet chocolate.  It was a very bitter and strong taste. If semi-sweet chocolate is your thing, this beer is for you.  Otherwise, I'd probably stick with a normal bock.",

I was pretty happy to hear that news, I went and turned off the kids alarm clock, re-adjusted mine, and fell happily back to sleep. \nIt is also really nice that the school started to do that to begin with. They now call everyone when there is a delay or a closure. It's much easier than waking up and checking for closures and I wouldn't have even thought to check today as the weather didn't seem to be out of the ordinary. The odd thing was that Hailey actually woke up earlier than usual today.  The kids will typically never wake up before their alarm on school days.  Yet, this morning Hailey was waking me up ten minutes before her alarm would have went off asking me some question.  I then let her know she could go back to bed as there was a delay.  She was really excited, but then asked if she could play on the computer.",

			"Hailey has a classmate at school that is being treated for cancer.  She wasn't close friends with her, but they did projects in class together and the whole incident has really affected Hailey. There has been some fundraisers where shirts and bracelets were being sold. Hailey had decided she wanted to purchase those, but she also wanted to raise some money herself.  At first, she initially wanted to start a lemonade stand, but I explained to her how that might not work so well in the middle of winter. She then thought about making some crafts and attempting to sell those.  While she has very good intentions, her ideas aren't 100% practical. I really liked the crafts she was making, but I didn't really have any ideas on how she would sell them.  Rachael made the suggestion that she could go door to door and collect pop bottles. We came up with the idea that instead of selling her crafts, she could give them to people in return for pop bottles she was collecting.",

We came up with the idea that instead of selling her crafts, she could give them to people in return for pop bottles she was collecting. \nHailey started visiting all the neighbors in our apartment complex.  Pretty quickly, she was coming back with garbage bags full of cans and also a fair amount of cash. The neighbors were very willing to help out. I posted a <a href='http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=501872016760&set=a.17114046760.59.503316760'>picture up on Facebook</a> of the cans Hailey had collected.  After that picture was up, she then got more donation offers from family and friends. Brett also decided that he wanted to help and gave $5 of his own money to the cause. Over the course of one weekend, she ended up raising $70. It was pretty exciting and Hailey felt really good about what she was doing. She was feeling like she could actually make a difference.  She is such a giving person that she couldn't stop there.  She also bought two shirts they were selling with her own money, one shirt for herself, one for Brett.  Overall, between her own money, and the money she raised, she had $100 for her classmate's family. This weekend, another fundraiser was taking place, a movie at a local theater in which proceeds were going toward her classmate's family.  I mentioned to Hailey that I we were planning to go there. She asks right away how much tickets were, and then she replied \"OK, that will be $20 total, I'll pay for it\".  It's very exciting to see how giving she is.  I let her know that this time the treat was on me though, as she has done so much to help out. \nI'm at that weird point now where I don't even know what to expect from my kids anymore. The simple milestones such as crawling and walking and talking are far past.  The milestones I now see are the times like this where they are willing to think beyond their own wants and needs and put other people first. It's nice to know they are able to act this way, as it's very easy to only be concerned with one's self. Additionally important, I think, is that Hailey is able to achieve this sense of charity without any type of feeling that it's somehow required of her, or that she will be rewarded somehow for this selfish act. I feel that religion often causes charity to happen for the wrong reasons and I hope that Hailey and Brett won't feel that they are expected by some power to be generous and that they will do it with their own will.",

I will think about all the things that are present in that room and try to imagine what it would be like to be a little kid and that room is all that I know. In a way, it is somewhat disturbing to me.  I try and wonder what it is like to be one of my children. I worry about what their life is like. I fear that their life may not be as good as the childhood that I experienced.\nAs a father, I feel this is my greatest fear.  That I am not providing the same life to my children that I was given. There are some reasons to fear this. I don't feel like I am financially as successful as my parents were when they were my age. Also, every time I think about the experiences of my children, I look back and think about what my life was like when I was their age. I think about the fact that I always grew up in a house. I never lived in an apartment as a child.  I wonder if this is a disadvantage to my kids. At the same time, I do consider the fact that they have a whole community of other kids to play with that also live in the apartment complex.  And they have things like a community pool to play in with the neighbor kids. But, they don't have their own house, or their own yard with me. However, their mom does have a house with these things.  So, in some sense, maybe having one parent with a house, and one parent with an apartment is somehow beneficial. I do feel that when I became an adult, I never really considered apartments at first due the fact that I never lived in one. I only considered living in a house. My kids may never have that issue. So, it's possible that I am giving them more life experiences.",

Playing this game has caused them for the first time to have a need to type fast on the computer.\nAnother skill they have developed is the ability to research online. Finding knowledge on the Internet is an invaluable skill to pick up and by having to learn how to do crafting, the kids are now experts at navigating the Minecraft wiki and finding what they need to know.\nYet another thing they are learning is something that I didn't even realize until just recently, division.

			"When using PHP, one issue I've had for a while is figuring out a way to map API input parameters to methods in my code.\n\nFor instance, I have an <a href='https://github.com/cbulock/JohnVanOrange/wiki/API'>API</a> for <a href='https://github.com/cbulock/JohnVanOrange'>John VanOrange</a> that allows anyone to access most of the site's functionality.

			"When using PHP, one issue I've had for a while is figuring out a way to map API input parameters to methods in my code.<br />\n<br />\nFor instance, I have an <a href='https://github.com/cbulock/JohnVanOrange/wiki/API'>API</a> for <a href='https://github.com/cbulock/JohnVanOrange'>John VanOrange</a> that allows anyone to access most of the site's functionality.  The public API methods all map to classes and functions inside those classes. Each of these methods allow for various parameters to be passed into them. <br />\n<br />\nHere is an example; let's say you want to add a tag to an image.  This requires two parameters, 'name' and 'image'. Using Jquery, the call would look like this:<br />\n<br />\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/cbulock/5297782.js\"></script><br />\n<br />\nMy issue has been, how do I allow users to easily define the parameters of these methods?<br />\n<br />\nWhy is this complicated? PHP doesn't have named parameters. This means that when passing parameters to a function, you must have the parameters be in a specified order.  This is needlessly complicated for some end user that doesn't know, and shouldn't have to know, the internal working of the API method. In the previous example, without named parameters, I would have to require the user to pass the tag and the image in a specific order, and there would be no rhyme or reason for it.<br />\n<br />\nHow have I been solving this problem?  Up until now, all the methods used with the public API had one single parameter, an array.  My interface for the public API would convert the request to an associative array and pass any and all the parameters into that array.<br />\n<br />\nExample:<br />\n<br />\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/cbulock/5297786.js\"></script><br />\n<br />\nThis has a TON of downsides.  This means that I then have to write code to check for required elements in that array.  I also have to write code to define default values for array elements.  It also means that writing usable PHP DocBlocks are out of the question.  Plus, editors are not able to auto-complete variables. I imagine there may be some security concerns as well, but in general, the whole concept is a big no-no.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI figured there had to be a better way.  There is <a href='http://php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php'>call_user_func</a> and <a href='http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func-array.php'>call_user_func_array</a> functions that allows calling functions passing the parameters if they are in an array. But, again, that requires an indexed array that already knows what order the parameters need to be in.  What I really need is a call_user_func_assoc_array that maps an associative array to the parameters within a function. But, alas, that doesn't exist.<br />\n<br />\nThere is hope however. PHP 5 introduced the <a href='http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php'>Reflection API</a>.  Honestly, I'm not that familiar with it, but after reading up on it, I learned it could solve my problem.<br />\n<br />\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/cbulock/5297798.js\"></script><br />\n<br />\nWhat all is that doing?  It's creating a ReflectionClass object that has details of the ins and out of the class we need to call.  Then, you create a ReflectionMethod object that has the details of the specific method we need access to.  Then, we can query the parameters of that method.  After that, it's as simple as a foreach loop to go through all the expected parameters of that method, and match any that are in the associative array that came from the public API.  Finally, we use invokeArgs to call the method.<br />\n<br />\nI imagine this code could be cleaned up a bit.  But, so far, this is doing exactly what I needed and I've been able to clean up all my code and remove all the arrays as function parameters.",

			"I got a <a href='http://getpebble.com/'>Pebble</a> smartwatch a little over a week ago. I've been asked how I liked it a number of times, so I decided I should probably just write an actual review down.\n\nFor anyone unaware of what the Pebble is, it is a watch that connects to your phone via Bluetooth.  An app runs on the phone and can enable the watch to have enhanced functions beyond what a normal watch would.\n\nThe main advantages of this is, for one, the watch face can be completely customizable.  Also, notifications on your phone can display on your watch.  No longer do you need to pull your phone out of your pocket every time someone sends you a text.\n\nSo far, I've been extremely happy with this watch. The thing I was initially surprised by was the size and weight of it. I expected the watch to be bigger and heavier than it actually is. It fits really nicely on my wrist.  The watchband itself isn't too fancy and is just a basic rubber band.  I might replace that with something better at a later point.  The good thing about this watch is that it will work with an 22mm watch band, so it can be replaced with a large variety of bands.\n\nThe display is really nice as well.  It's a basic black and white display.  Only 1-bit color, so no grayscale.  The resolution isn't extremely high, like a retina screen, but the text is decently clear and readable. The screen is very easy to view outdoors in sunlight, and there is also a backlight for viewing in the dark. Another nice thing is that the display is always on. Cell phones haven't been like that in a long time, and it's nice to have the screen always readily available to view.\nAs for the rest of the hardware, it doesn't have a touch screen, but there are four buttons to navigate the menus with.  The navigation is really straightforward. On the left size of the watch, there is a single button that activates the backlight when viewing a watch-face, and acts as a \"back\" button when browsing through menus.  On the right side, there are three buttons, the first is an \"up\" button, the second is a \"select\" button and the third is a \"down\" button.  Another nice feature of the watch is the fact that it is waterproof. It can be used in a shower, and you can also swim with it. I've made sure to test this out quite a bit, and it works as advertised.\n\nThe charging is pretty slick. The watch does require a proprietary charger, but it's a nice one. It connects to USB to get power and connects magnetically to the side of the watch.  I really like this as I feel like I'm not going to be breaking any charging connectors and this also helps keep water out of the device. The watch is advertised to only have to be charged once every 5-7 days, and even though I have been using the watch more than usual due to it being new, I did get 5 days of use before it required a charge.\n\nFor the software side of things, I can only say what the experience is like from an Android phone. It sounds like the iPhone software has much more limitations, and the experience with those phones isn't quite as nice. The default software that Pebble has for Android does a lot of what you need. It will allow the watch to display phone calls, texts, Hangout messages, Facebook messages, calendar reminders and possibly a few other notifications. These pop up on the watch, and the watch will vibrate to alert there is a notification.  I find this to work really well.  With my phone being in my pocket, I often don't notice when there is an incoming call or incoming alerts. It is now really easy to not miss these, plus you can see right away who is calling, or if a message is important or not.  For the phone calls, you can even push a button to ignore calls right from the watch.\n\nThankfully, the default software isn't the only software you have to use.  You can install other apps that can push alerts to the watch.  I installed a free app, <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dattasmoon.pebble.plugin&hl=en'>Pebble Notifier</a>. With that, you can have any notifications from any app on your phone be sent to the watch. You can choose which apps you want. With that, I am able to get any alert I want to show up on my watch.\n\nBeyond the notifications is the watch faces. The watch comes with a few basic ones that are nice, but there are so many more options out there.  For starters, there is a great site, <a href='http://www.mypebblefaces.com/'>My Pebble Faces</a>, that let has tons of options available. I was using some watch faces from there, but then I discovered something even better. <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pennas.pebblecanvas&hl=en'>Canvas for Pebble</a> has the ability to create customized watch faces directly from the phone. It has a number of data layers and you can customize the position and display of each layer.  Currently, I have the date, time, current temperature and phone battery level all displaying on my watch.  You can also optionally have calendar events and the current track playing on your phone show as well.\n\nWith a week or so of usage, I'm overall really happy with the watch.  The ability to have notifications readily available is one of the big reason's I was excited about Google Glass. I feel having them on my watch is the next best thing, and it looks less socially awkward.  There are some other smartwatches that will be available in the near future, but this one is really nice as a 1st gen model.",

			"Two days before my first child was born, I decided to start a blog to document my new life as being a father.  That was 18 years ago. A lot has changed since then. Over that time, I've posted less and less. I haven't posted anything at all in several years. I think this is mostly due to social media being the main place where I post day-to-day things now.\n\nThis site has sort of been a playground for my technical skills.  Back in 2003, I was out of touch with web development, so I just installed Movable Type and used that as the blogging software. This was easy to get started with and I soon learned how to customize it more and more. It was at this point in time that I started getting more serious about working with code.  Some of my first bug fixes and features submitted to an open-source project were for Movable Type plugins.\n\nEventually, I spent some time and wrote fully custom templates for Movable Type. This allowed the site to have a completely custom look. Around that time, I started to learn PHP and began adding additional features using that.\n\nOnce I started to get more comfortable with PHP, I embarked on my biggest project yet.  Trying to create my own custom CMS from the ground up.  That ended up turning out really well.  I was able to ramp up my PHP skills and create a whole new site that was no longer built using Movable Type, but my own code. For the most part, that was the last iteration of this site up until very recently.\n\nI hadn't posted anything since 2013, so this site is essentially dead.  However, I have some sentimental feelings about the content here, so I don't want to just let the posts disappear. To keep the content, I wanted to move everything into a git repo somewhere.  All the post content was in a MySQL database (in fact, the same database created by Movable Type all those years ago, my CMS was backward compatible with that), so first I dumped all that data into JSON.\n\nToday, I work as a React developer, so I thought, \"why not just recreate this as a modern React app\", so I did that.  It's not the most efficient thing. All the data is still one giant JSON object.  But, I was able to put it together in a matter of a few hours. Made sure all the URLs are still working just as they did in 2013.  But now, it's all on Github and can be easily deployed using a site like Netlify.\n\nThis may very well be my last post here.  I'm happy to see that the site should remain online for some time to come. It's been a great learning experience from then to now.",
